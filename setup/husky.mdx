# Husky

> Ultra-fast modern native git hooks
> 

Husky enhances your commits and more 🐶 *woof!*

Automatically **lint your commit messages**, **code**, and **run tests** upon committing or pushing.

Get started [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/get-started.html).

## Features

- Just `2 kB` (📦 *gzipped*) with no dependencies
- Fastest due to being lightweight (runs in `~1ms`)
- Uses new Git feature (`core.hooksPath`)
- Supports:
    - macOS, Linux, Windows
    - Git GUIs, Node version managers, custom hooks directory, nested projects, monorepos
    - [All 13 client-side Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks)

And more:

- Branch-specific hooks
- Use POSIX shell to script advanced cases
- Adheres to Git's native hook organization
- Aligns with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts#best-practices) best practices using `prepare` script
- Opt-in/opt-out options
- Can be globally disabled
- User-friendly error messages

# Get started | Husky

## Install

`bun add --dev husky`

## `husky init` (recommended)

The `init` command simplifies setting up husky in a project. It creates a `pre-commit` script in `.husky/` and updates the `prepare` script in `package.json`. Modifications can be made later to suit your workflow.

`bunx husky init`

## Try it

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your first Git hook with just one command 🎉. Let's test it:

```bash
git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"
# test script will run every time you commit
```

## A few words...

### Scripting

While most of the time, you'll just run a few `npm run` or `npx` commands in your hooks, you can also script them using POSIX shell for custom workflows.

For example, here's how you can lint your staged files on each commit with only two lines of shell code and no external dependency:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
prettier $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | sed 's| |\\\\ |g') --write --ignore-unknown
git update-index --again
```

*This is a basic but working example, check [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) if you need more.*

### Disabling hooks

Husky doesn't force Git hooks. It can be globally disabled (`HUSKY=0`) or be opt-in if wanted. See the [How To](https://typicode.github.io/husky/how-to.html) section for manual setup and more information.

# How To | Husky

## Adding a New Hook

Adding a hook is as simple as creating a file. This can be accomplished using your favorite editor, a script or a basic echo command. For example, on Linux/macOS:

```bash
`echo "npm test" > .husky/pre-commit`
```

## Startup files

Husky allows you to execute local commands before running hooks. It reads commands from these files:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/husky/init.sh`
- `~/.config/husky/init.sh`
- `~/.huskyrc` (deprecated)

On Windows: `C:\\Users\\yourusername\\.config\\husky\\init.sh`

## Skipping Git Hooks

### For a Single Command

Most Git commands include a `-n/--no-verify` option to skip hooks:

sh

`git commit -m "..." -n # Skips Git hooks`

For commands without this flag, disable hooks temporarily with HUSKY=0:

```bash
HUSKY=0 git ... # Temporarily disables all Git hooks
git ... # Hooks will run again
```

### For multiple commands

To disable hooks for an extended period (e.g., during rebase/merge):

```bash
export HUSKY=0 # Disables all Git hooks
git ...
git ...
unset HUSKY # Re-enables hooks
```

### For a GUI or Globally

To disable Git hooks in a GUI client or globally, modify the husky config:

```bash
# ~/.config/husky/init.sh
export HUSKY=0 # Husky won't install and won't run hooks on your machine
```

## CI server and Docker

To avoid installing Git Hooks on CI servers or in Docker, use `HUSKY=0`. For instance, in GitHub Actions:

```yml
# <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables>
env:
  HUSKY: 0
```

If installing only `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`), the `"prepare": "husky"` script may fail because Husky won't be installed.

You have multiple solutions.

Modify the `prepare` script to never fail:

```json
// package.json
"prepare": "husky || true"
```

You'll still get a `command not found` error message in your output which may be confusing. To make it silent, create `.husky/install.mjs`:


```js
// Skip Husky install in production and CI
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.CI === 'true') {
  process.exit(0)
}
const husky = (await import('husky')).default
console.log(husky())
```

Then, use it in `prepare`:

`"prepare": "node .husky/install.mjs"`

## Testing Hooks Without Committing

To test a hook, add `exit 1` to the hook script to abort the Git command:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit

# Your WIP script
# ...

exit 1
```

```bash
git commit -m "testing pre-commit code"
# A commit will not be created
```

## Project Not in Git Root Directory

Husky doesn't install in parent directories (`../`) for security reasons. However, you can change the directory in the `prepare` script.

Consider this project structure:

```
.
├── .git/
├── backend/  # No package.json
└── frontend/ # Package.json with husky
```

Set your prepare script like this:

json

`"prepare": "cd .. && husky frontend/.husky"`

In your hook script, change the directory back to the relevant subdirectory:

```bash
# frontend/.husky/pre-commit
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Non-shell hooks

In order to run scripts that require the use of a scripting language, use the following pattern for each applicable hook:

(Example using hook `pre-commit` and NodeJS)

1. Create an entrypoint for the hook:shell

`.husky/pre-commit`
2.   In the file add the following shell

`node .husky/pre-commit.js`
3.   in `.husky/pre-commit.js`javascript

```
// Your NodeJS code
// ...
```

## Bash

Hook scripts need to be POSIX compliant to ensure best compatibility as not everyone has `bash` (e.g. Windows users).

That being said, if your team doesn't use Windows, you can use Bash this way:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit

bash << EOF
# Put your bash script inside
# ...
EOF
```

## Node Version Managers and GUIs

If you're using Git hooks in GUIs with Node installed via a version manager (like `nvm`, `n`, `fnm`, `asdf`, `volta`, etc...), you might face a `command not found` error due to `PATH` environment variable issues.

### Understanding `PATH` and Version Managers

`PATH` is an environment variable containing a list of directories. Your shell searches these directories for commands. If it doesn't find a command, you get a `command not found` message.

Run `echo $PATH` in a shell to view its contents.

Version managers work by:

1. Adding initialization code to your shell startup file (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.), which runs each time you open a terminal.
2. Downloading Node versions to a directory in your home folder.

For example, if you have two Node versions:

```bash
~/version-manager/Node-X/node
~/version-manager/Node-Y/node
```

Opening a terminal initializes the version manager, which picks a version (say `Node-Y`) and prepends its path to `PATH`:

```bash
echo $PATH
# Output
~/version-manager/Node-Y/:...
```

Now, node refers to `Node-Y`. Switching to `Node-X` changes `PATH` accordingly:

shell

```
echo $PATH
# Output
~/version-manager/Node-X/:...

```

The issue arises because GUIs, launched outside a terminal, don't initialize the version manager, leaving `PATH` without the Node install path. Thus, Git hooks from GUIs often fail.

### Solution

Husky sources `~/.config/husky/init.sh` before each Git hook. Copy your version manager initialization code here to ensure it runs in GUIs.

Example with `nvm`:

```bash
# ~/.config/husky/init.sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \\. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

Alternatively, if your shell startup file is fast and lightweight, source it directly:

```bash
# ~/.config/husky/init.sh
. ~/.zshrc
```

## Manual setup

Git needs to be configured and husky needs to setup files in `.husky/`.

Run the `husky` command once in your repo. Ideally, include it in the `prepare` script in `package.json` for automatic execution after each install (recommended).

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // Yarn doesn't support prepare script
    "postinstall": "husky",
    // Include this if publishing to npmjs.com
    "prepack": "pinst --disable",
    "postpack": "pinst --enable"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky"
  }
}
```

* Run `prepare` once:

```bash
`bun run prepare`
```

* Create a `pre-commit` file in the `.husky/` directory:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
bun test
```
