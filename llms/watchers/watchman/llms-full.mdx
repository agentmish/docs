Watchman - A file watching service | Watchman

Watchman exists to watch files and record when they change. It can also trigger
actions (such as rebuilding assets) when matching files change.

## Concepts

- Watchman can recursively watch one or more directory trees (we call them
  roots).
- Watchman does not follow symlinks. It knows they exist, but they show up the
  same as any other file in its reporting.
- Watchman waits for a root to settle down before it will start to trigger
  notifications or command execution.
- Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution; it
  considers files to be freshly changed when you start to watch them or when it
  is unsure.
- You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the current
  state of the tree
- You can subscribe to file changes that occur in a root

## Quickstart

These two lines establish a watch on a source directory and then set up a
trigger named buildme that will run a tool named `minify-css`whenever a CSS file
is changed. The tool will be passed a list of the changed filenames.

    $ watchman watch ~/src# the single quotes around '*.css' are important!$ watchman -- trigger ~/src buildme '*.css' -- minify-css

The output for buildme will land in the Watchman log file unless you send it
somewhere else.

watchman-wait | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

`watchman-wait` waits for changes to files. It uses the watchman service to
efficiently and recursively watch your specified list of paths.

It is suitable for waiting for changes to files from shell scripts. It has some
similarity to `inotifywait` except that it uses the watchman service to watch
files and thus can be used on any of the operating systems supported by
watchman, not just Linux.

It can stop after a configurable number of events are observed. The default is a
single event. You may also remove the limit and allow it to execute
continuously.

`watchman-wait` will print one event per line. The event information includes
your specified list of fields, with each field separated by a space (or your
choice of `--separator`).

Events are consolidated and settled by the watchman server before they are
dispatched to `watchman-wait` so that your script won't start executing until
after the files have stopped changing.

`watchman-wait` requires `pywatchman` (and thus requires `python`) as well as
`watchman`.

    $ watchman-wait path [path ...]

The primary unit of watching is a path. You must specify a list of one or more
paths that you'd like to wait for. Paths can be files or directories. Each of
the paths in your list must exist at the time that you invoke `watchman-wait` or
an error will be reported and `watchman-wait` will exit.

If you'd like to wait for a file to be created you can watch the directory in
which it will be created. You may further refine your watch by limiting it to a
set of patterns.

    $ watchman-wait . -p '*.so'

    $ watchman-wait -p '*.so' -- .

Both of the above will wait for a shared object file to be changed in any path
under the current working directory. Since both the `-p` option and the list of
paths accept one or more parameters, the second form shows how to disambiguate
between the list of patterns and the list of paths using the `--` separator.

Patterns are wildmatch style globs that support recursive matching via the `**`
placeholder.

You should always quote your pattern parameters so that they are not evaluated
by your shell.

There are two primary controls for how long `watchman-wait` will run:

- `-t` or `--timeout` places a time limit on execution
- `-m` or `--max-events` places a limit on the number of events to process

`watchman-wait` will terminate when either the timeout is hit or the max events
limit is hit.

By default there is no time limit, but there is a default limit of a single
event.

You may specify `--max-events 0` to disable the event limit.

`watchman-wait` will output one line per event. The following options influence
the output:

- `--fields NAME,NAME` - specifies the list of fields to be printed for each
  event. The default is `--fields name` which will print just the `name` of the
  file that was changed. You may use any of the available fields listed in
  [available fields](/watchman/docs/cmd/query#available-fields). The fields will
  be printed in the order you list them.
- `--relative DIR` - the `name` field will be adjusted to be relative to `DIR`
  before it is printed out. The default for `DIR` is the current working
  directory when `watchman-wait` is started.
- `--separator STRING` - if you specified multiple fields, the separator string
  will be used when printing them. The default is `--separator " "` which will
  print the fields with spaces between them.

The following exit status codes can be used to determine what caused
`watchman-wait` to exit:

- `0` is returned after successfully waiting for event(s)
- `1` in case of a runtime error of some kind
- `2` the `-t`/`--timeout` option was used and that amount of time passed before
  an event was received
- `3` if execution was interrupted (Ctrl-C)

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/watchman-replicate-subscription

watchman-replicate-subscription | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 5.0_

`watchman-replicate-subscription` can replicate an existing watchman
subscription. It queries watchman for a list of subscriptions, identifies the
source subscription (the subscription to replicate) and subscribes to watchman
using the same query.

Integrators can use this client to validate the watchman notifications their
client is receiving to localize anomalous behavior.

The source subscription is identified using any combination of the 'name',
'pid', and 'client' arguments. The provided combination must uniquely identify a
subscription. Source subscription details for a watched root can be retrieved by
running the command 'watchman-replicate-subscription --list PATH'.

By default, the replicated subscription will take the source subscription name
and prepend the substring 'replicate: ' to it. The 'qname' option can be used to
specify the replicated subscription name.

The subscription can stop after a configurable number of events are observed.
The default is a single event. You may also remove the limit and allow it to
execute continuously.

watchman-replicate-subscription will print one event per line. The event
information is determined by the fields in the identified subscription, with
each field separated by a space (or your choice of --separator).

Subscription state-enter and state-leave PDUs will be interleaved with other
events. Known subscription PDUs (currently only those generated by the mercurial
fsmonitor extension) will be enclosed in square brackets. All others will be
output in JSON format.

Events are consolidated and settled by the watchman server before they are
dispatched to watchman-replicate-subscription.

`watchman-replicate-subscription` requires pywatchman (and thus requires python)
as well as watchman.

    $ watchman-replicate-subscription PATH -n NAME

The source subscription must be an existing subscription for the provided path.
Any combination of the 'name', 'pid', and 'client' arguments can be used
provided they uniquely identify a subscription. Source subscription details for
a watched root can be retrieved as follows:

    $ watchman-replicate-subscriptions PATH --list

The subscription name, pid and client can then used to replicate the
subscription.

    $ watchman-replicate-subscription PATH -n NAME -c CLIENT -p PID

There are two primary controls for how long `watchman-replicate-subscription`
will run:

- `-t` or `--timeout` places a time limit on execution
- `-m` or `--max-events` places a limit on the number of events to process

`watchman-replicate-subscription` will terminate when either the timeout is hit
or the max events limit is hit.

By default there is no time limit, but there is a default limit of a single
event.

You may specify `--max-events 0` to disable the event limit.

`watchman-replicate-subscription` will output one line per event. The following
options influence the output:

- `--separator STRING` - if you specified multiple fields, the separator string
  will be used when printing them. The default is `--separator " "` which will
  print the fields with spaces between them.

The following exit status codes can be used to determine what caused
`watchman-replicate-subscription` to exit:

- `0` is returned after successfully waiting for event(s) or listing matching
  subscriptions
- `1` in case of a runtime error of some kind
- `2` the `-t`/`--timeout` option was used and that amount of time passed before
  an event was received
- `3` if execution was interrupted (Ctrl-C)

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/watchman-make

watchman-make | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

`watchman-make` is a convenience tool to help automatically invoke a build tool
or script in response to files changing. It is useful to automate building
assets or running tests as you save files during development.

`watchman-make` will establish a watch on the files you specify and remain
running in the foreground, waiting for changes to occur. When a change is
triggered, your build tool or script will be run in the foreground with its
output being passed through to your terminal session (or wherever you may have
redirected it).

Events are consolidated and settled before they are dispatched to your build
tool so that it won't start executing until after the files have stopped
changing. The `--settle` argument controls the settle duration.

`watchman-make` requires `pywatchman` (and thus requires `python`) as well as
`watchman`.

    $ watchman-make -p '**/*.c' '**/*.h' 'Makefile*' -t all -p 'tests/**/*.py' 'tests/**/*.c' -t integration# Relative to /Users/wez/fb/watchman# Changes to files matching **/*.c **/*.h Makefile* will execute `make all`# Changes to files matching tests/**/*.py tests/**/*.c will execute `make integration`# waiting for changes

You can tell `watchman-make` about one or more build targets and their
dependencies, and it will then trigger the build for those targets as changes
are detected.

The example above defines two targets using the `-t` argument; `all` and
`integration`. These correspond to targets with the same names in the watchman
`Makefile`. Each target will pick up the list of patterns defined by the `-p`
argument that precedes it.

    $ watchman-make -p '**/*.c' '**/*.h' -t all

The above defines a target named `all` that will be triggered whenever any
combination of files are changed that have filenames that match either of the
patterns `*.c` or `*.h` at any level in the directory tree (that's what the `**`
portion means). When it triggers, `watchman-make` will execute `make all`.

If you don't use `make`, you can use the `--make` option to tell `watchman-make`
to use your builder of choice. When a target is triggered, `watchman-make` will
concatenate the value of `--make` with the name of the target and execute that
command using the shell.

The target name has no special meaning to `watchman-make`, it is used only to
construct the command to invoke. There is no special logic or support that is
specific to Makefiles or make.

There are two different ways to specify multiple targets. The first is shown in
the main example at the top of this page and is repeated here:

    $ watchman-make -p '*.c' '*.h' 'Makefile*' -t all -p 'tests/**/*.py' 'tests/**/*.c' -t integration

This defines two independent targets, `all` and `integration` that each have a
list of patterns defined as their triggers. Each time you specify a target using
the `-t` option, the value of the `-p` option is cleared.

The above will cause `make all` to be run if you change a file that matches
`.*c` (at the top level of the tree), and will cause `make integration` to run
if you change a source file under the tests directory.

An alternative is to list multiple target names with your `-t` option:

    $ watchman-make -p '*.c' '*.h' 'Makefile*' 'tests/**/*.py' 'tests/**/*.c' -t all integration

this will execute `make all integration` if you change any top level `*.c` file
_or_ test source file.

_Since 4.8._

As an alternative to targets, you can provide the path to a script which
`watchman-make` will execute when changes are detected.

    $ watchman-make -p '**/*.c' '**/*.h' --run my_script.sh

The above will run the provided script whenever any combination of files are
changed that have filenames that match either of the patterns `*.c` or `*.h` at
any level in the directory tree. When it triggers, `watchman-make` will execute
`my_script.sh`.

You must run `watchman-make` with either `--target` or `--run`, but they cannot
be run together

Troubleshooting | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

We try to give directed advice in Watchman error diagnostics, which means that
we will show a link to a section on this page with some context and advice where
we have enough information to do so. Some operating systems provide richer
diagnostic information than others, so we have to resort to more generic advice
in some cases.

The most common cause of problems is hitting system resource limits. There are
finite resources available for filesystem watching, and when they are exceeded
it can impact performance in the best case or prohibit correct operation in the
worst case.

It is generally a good idea to make sure that you are using the latest version
of the software, so that you avoid any known issues.

If you are running a pre-built binary provided by your operating system
distribution system, there is a chance that you'll need to build the latest
version from source. You can find instructions for this in
[the installation section](/watchman/docs/install).

A recrawl is an action that Watchman performs in order to recover from
situations where it believes that it has lost sync with the state of the
filesystem.

The most common cause for a recrawl is on Linux systems where the default
inotify limits are sized quite small. What this means is that the rate at which
your watched roots are generating changes is higher than the kernel can buffer
and relay to the watchman service. When this happens, the kernel detects the
overflow and signals `IN_Q_OVERFLOW`. The recovery is to recursively scan the
root to make sure that we know what is really there and re-sync with the
notification stream.

Frequent recrawls are undesirable because they result in a potentially expensive
full tree crawl, which marks all files as changed and propagates this status to
clients which will in turn perform some action on the (likely falsely) changed
state of the majority of files.

There is no simple formula for setting your system limits; bigger is better but
comes at the cost of kernel memory to maintain the buffers. You and/or your
system administrator should review the workload for your system and the
[System Specific Preparation Documentation](/watchman/docs/install#system-specific-preparation)
and raise your limits accordingly.

macOS has a similar internal limit and behavior when that limit is exceeded. If
you're encountering a message like:

    Recrawled this watch 1 times, most recently because:/some/path: kFSEventStreamEventFlagUserDropped

then you are hitting the limits of your system. There is no direct control over
the limit, but starting in Watchman 3.2 you may increase the
[fsevents\_latency](/watchman/docs/config#fsevents-latency) parameter in your
`.watchmanconfig` file.

The warning will stick until you cancel the watch and reinstate it, or restart
the watchman process. The simplest resolution is to run
`watchman shutdown-server` and re-establish your watch on your next watchman
query.

Watchman places logs in a file named `<STATEDIR>/<USER>.log`, where `STATEDIR`
is set at the time that you built watchman.

If you used the `--enable-statedir=<STATEDIR>` configure option, that will be
the location that holds your logs. If not, the default for `STATEDIR` will be
`<PREFIX>/var/run/watchman`, or for older versions of watchman, the logs may be
placed in `<TMPDIR>/.watchman.<USER>.log`.

_Since 3.8._

Watchman places the logs in a file named `<STATEDIR>/log`, which will typically
be a location like `<PREFIX>/var/run/watchman/<USER>-state/log`. If you're
running a `homebrew` build of watchman, `<PREFIX>` is usually `/usr/local`.

The default log location may be overridden by the `--logfile`
[Server Option](/watchman/docs/cli-options#server-options).

[Quick note on default locations](/watchman/docs/cli-options#quick-note-on-default-locations)
explains what we mean by `<STATEDIR>`, `<TMPDIR>`, `<USER>` and so on.

Poison:
inotify\_add\_watch[​](#poison-inotify_add_watch "Direct link to heading")

    A non-recoverable condition has triggered.  Watchman needs your help!The triggering condition was at timestamp=1407695600: inotify-add-watch(/my/path) -> Cannot allocate memoryAll requests will continue to fail with this message until you resolvethe underlying problem.  You will find more information on fixing this athttps://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/troubleshooting.html#poison-inotify-add-watch

If you've encountered this state it means that your _kernel_ was unable to watch
a dir in one or more of the roots you've asked it to watch. This particular
condition is considered non-recoverable by Watchman on the basis that nothing
that the Watchman service can do can guarantee that the root cause is resolved,
and while the system is in this state, Watchman cannot guarantee that it can
respond with the correct results that its clients depend upon. We consider
ourselves poisoned and will fail all requests for all watches (not just the
watch that it triggered on) until the process is restarted.

There are two primary reasons that this can trigger:

- The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the
  kernel failed to allocate a needed resource
- Insufficient kernel memory was available

The resolution for the former is to revisit
[System Specific Preparation Documentation](/watchman/docs/install#system-specific-preparation)
and raise your limits accordingly.

The latter condition implies that your workload is exceeding the available RAM
on the machine. It is difficult to give specific advice to resolve this
condition here; you may be able to tune down other system limits to free up some
resources, or you may just need to install more RAM in the system.

The error will stick until you restart the watchman process. The simplest
resolution is:

_Since 4.6_

    $ watchman watch-del-all$ watchman shutdown-server

_Before 4.6_

    $ rm <STATEDIR>/state       # see above for what STATEDIR means$ watchman --no-spawn --no-local shutdown-server

If you have not actually resolved the root cause you may continue to trigger and
experience this state each time the system trips over these limits.

    A non-recoverable condition has triggered.  Watchman needs your help!The triggering condition was at timestamp=1407695600: opendir(/my/path) -> Too many open files in systemAll requests will continue to fail with this message until you resolvethe underlying problem.  You will find more information on fixing this athttps://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/troubleshooting.html#opendir

If you've encountered this state it means that your entire system had too many
open files, and that this prevented watchman from tracking the changes on your
system. In this case, the error isn't related to filesystem watching but to
other (likely) misbehaving processes on your system; it's usually indicative of
a runaway program or set of programs consuming resources, but in some cases it
may just be that your system workload requires that you increase your system
limits for the number of files.

[Follow these directions](/watchman/docs/troubleshooting#i-39-ve-changed-my-limits-how-can-i-clear-the-error)

If the issue persists, consult your system administrator to identify what is
consuming these resources and remediate it, or to increase your system limits.

FSEvents is the file watching facility on macOS. There are few diagnostics that
can help diagnose issues with FSEvents; the API itself gives little feedback on
a number of error cases and instead emits rather cryptic error messages to the
log file.

If you got here because an error message told you to read this section, it will
have also asked you to look at your log file. If you are using an older version
of watchman and encounter the error message `FSEventStreamStart failed`, then
you should locate your log file (see [Where are the logs?](#where-are-the-logs)
above) and look for lines that mention FSEvents and then consult the information
below.

Nobody outside of Apple is sure what precisely this means, but it indicates that
the fsevents service has gotten in a bad state. Possible reasons for this may
include:

- There are too many event stream clients
- One or more event stream clients has gotten in a bad state and is somehow
  impacting the fsevents service

To resolve this issue, you may wish to try the following, which are
progressively more invasive:

- Avoid establishing multiple overlapping watches within the same filesystem
  tree, especially for large trees. We recommend watching only the root of a
  project or repo and not watching sub-trees within that tree. Organizations
  with large trees may wish to deploy the
  [root\_restrict\_files](/watchman/docs/config#root-restrict-files)
  configuration option so that watchman will only allow watching project roots.
- Close or restart other applications that are using fsevents. Some examples
  are:
- editors such as Sublime Text and TextMate.
- Many nodejs packages and Grunt style workflows make use of fsevents. Make sure
  that you upgrade nodejs to at least version `v0.11.14`. If possible, configure
  your nodejs packages to use either [sane](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sane)
  or [fb-watchman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fb-watchman) for file watching
  as this will consolidate the number of fsevents watches down to just the set
  maintained by watchman.
- Restart the fsevents service: `sudo pkill -9 -x fseventsd`
- Restart your computer

There is a rare fsevents bug that can prevent any notifications from working in
directories where the case of the name of a directory in the kernel has an
inconsistency.

You can test whether this is happening to you by following
[the instructions for the find-fsevents-bugs tool](https://github.com/andreyvit/find-fsevents-bugs).

If it is happening to you, the resolution is to rename the directories
highlighted by the tool.

You can read more about this issue in the following resources:

- [Knowledge base article for LiveReload](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86239-os-x-fsevents-bug-may-prevent-monitoring-of-certai)
- [issue for the Ruby fsevents module](https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/10)
- [Open Radar bug report](http://openradar.appspot.com/10207999)

There was an issue that was the result of umask affecting the permissions of the
launchd plist file that Watchman uses to set up your watchman service on OS X.
This issue was resolved in Watchman version 3.1.

Socket Interface | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Most simple uses of Watchman will invoke the watchman binary and process its
output. Sometimes it is desirable to avoid the overhead of an extra process and
talk directly to your watchman service.

The watchman service runs as a single long-lived process per user. The watchman
binary will take care of spawning the server process if necessary.

The server will create a unix domain socket for communication with its clients.
The location of the socket depends on compile time options and command line
flags. It is recommended that you invoke `watchman get-sockname` to discover the
location, or if you are being invoked via a trigger (since version 2.9.7) you
will find the location in the `$WATCHMAN_SOCK` environmental variable.

The unix socket implements a request-response protocol with PDUs encoded in
either JSON or BSER representation. Some watchman commands (notably `subscribe`
and `log-level`) allow the watchman service to unilaterally send any number of
PDUs to the client, and require more stateful handling.

The JSON encoding represents a request or a response as a single line of compact
JSON encoded data. The newline is used to detect the end of the PDU.

Requests from the client are always represented as a JSON array.

Responses from the server are always represented as a JSON object.

Sending the `since` command is simply a matter of formatting it as JSON. Note
that the JSON text must be a single line (don't send a pretty printed version of
it!) and be followed by a newline `\n` character:

    ["since", "/path/to/src", "n:c_srcs", "*.c"] <NEWLINE>

BSER is a local-only binary serialization format that can represent the same
data types as JSON, but in a more compact form and not be limited to UTF-8
representation of strings.

When you make a request using BSER, the server will respond in BSER encoding.

You can [read more about BSER in the BSER specification](/watchman/docs/bser).

If a Response includes a field named `error` it indicates that the request was
not successful. The `error` field, if present, is a string value that can be
presented to the user.

If a Response includes a field named `warning` it indicates that there is some
condition that should be reported back to the user so that the system can
operate more effectively. Tools should display this to the user as an advisory.
At the time of writing, this can be triggered due to overflowing the system
limits on file watching resources. These are important to address so that events
are not missed and thus so that correctness and system performance are
maintained.

The warning message contains a link to this documentation that provides advice
on tuning and resolving the issue.

Simple Pattern Syntax | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Simple patterns follow a more traditional UNIX command line approach of using
command line switches to indicate the nature of the pattern match. When simple
patterns are used, the result set unconditionally includes all core file
metadata fields. They are described in more detail below.

Where you see `[patterns]` in the command syntax for the `find`, `since` and
`trigger` commands, we allow filename patterns that match according the
following rules:

- We maintain an _inclusion_ and an _exclusion_ list. As the arguments are
  processed we'll accumulate them in one or the other. By default they are
  accumulated into the _inclusion_ list.
- `-X` causes any subsequent items to be placed into the _exclusion_ list
- `-I` causes any subsequent items to be placed into the _inclusion_ list
- `--` indicates the end of the set of patterns
- `-p` indicates that the following pattern should use `pcre` as the expression
  term. This is reset after generating the next term.
- `-P` indicates that the following pattern should use `ipcre` as the expression
  term and perform a case insensitive match. This is reset after generating the
  next term.
- If neither `-p` nor `-P` were used, the generated term will use `match`
- `!` followed by a space followed by a pattern will negate the sense of the
  pattern match generating a `not` term.

Any elements in the inclusion list will match; they are composed together using
an "anyof" term.

The inclusion list and exclusion lists are composed using the logic
`(NOT anyof exclusion) AND (anyof inclusion)`.

For example:

    '*.c'

Generates a file expression:

    ["match", "*.c", "wholename"]

A list:

    '*.js' '*.css'

    ["anyof",  ["match", "*.js", "wholename"],  ["match", "*.css", "wholename"]]

An example of how the exclusion list syntax works:

    -X '*.c' -I '*main*'

Generates:

    ["allof",  ["not", ["match", "*.c", "wholename"]],  ["match", "*main*", "wholename"]]

changes in a version controlled repository. For most repos it is fine to simply
receive information about all changed files as they are updated, even during a
rebase over several days of work by others.

For very large or very busy repositories, where a great many files can change
over a short period of time, it can be desirable to get a minimized set of
information about the changes.

For example, if your tool has the ability to load some pre-built data from some
artifact storage, rather than processing many hundreds of changed files
incrementally you may want to take the merge base of local changes and use that
to locate the pre-built data and process only the delta between that state and
the current state of the repo.

An illustration may help. Here we see that a user has a stack of two commits
based off the symbolic `main` commit. In this scenario, `main` is tracking the
tip of the repo to which the local repo is published, and the user is checked
out at the 6b38a5 commit:

    | @  6b38a5  wez| |  Add cats.cpp| || o  fa2e92  wez|/   Add cat.jpg|o f12345 main

Now the user synchronizes their repo with the remote, fetching the commits but
not changing their work yet. This is often combined with the step that follows,
but we are breaking it out here for the purposes of illustration. This is
equivalent to running `hg pull` or `git fetch`:

    o  fabf87  coworker     main.  Amazing new feature.| @  6b38a5  wez| |  Add cats.cpp| || o  fa2e92  wez|/   Add cat.jpg|o

The ellipsis portion of the DAG represents uninteresting commits to `wez`; there
may be hundreds of files changed by those commits, but `wez` only cares about
the work in their local branch of the DAG.

Now `wez` wants to rebase their work on main. This would be done using a command
like `hg rebase -d main -s fa2e92`:

    | @  bbbbbb  wez| |  Add cats.cpp| || o  aaaaaa  wez|/   Add cat.jpg|o  fabf87  coworker     main.  Amazing new feature.

The crucial part of this is what happens to the working copy; assuming that we
now land on commit `bbbbbb`, Watchman will observe changes for all of the
hundreds of files that changed across the rebase and pass this information on to
the tools that are subscribed or are querying for this information.

If your tooling is source control aware then you can ask watchman to run since
queries in a mode where it will return you information about the merge base with
`main` and the minimized set of files that changed.

To enable this mode you issue a query using a new _fat clock_ as the `since`
parameter for the query:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "since": {      "scm": {        "mergebase-with": "main"      }  },  "expression": ["type", "f"],  "fields": ["name"]}]EOT

This particular `since` value starts with an unspecified clock value and
requests that watchman run the query in source control aware mode, using the
symbolic name `main` to compute the merge base for the commit graph.

If we look back to the illustrations above and rewind to the first scenario, the
results of this query will look something like this:

    {   "clock": {       "clock": "c:123:123",       "scm": {            "mergebase": "f12345",            "mergebase-with": "main"       }    },    "files": ["cat.jpg", "cats.cpp"]}

This result informs the client of the merge base with main (which happens to be
main itself) and the list of changes since that merge base.

To get the next incremental change the client feeds that clock value back in to
its next query. Looking back to the second illustration above, if we were to run
this query after the running `hg pull` (note that this doesn't change the
working copy):

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "since": {       "clock": "c:123:123",       "scm": {            "mergebase": "f12345",            "mergebase-with": "main"       }  },  "expression": ["type", "f"],  "fields": ["name"]}]EOT

we'd get this result:

    {   "clock": {       "clock": "c:123:124",       "scm": {            "mergebase": "f12345",            "mergebase-with": "main"       }    },    "files": []}

Note that the `files` list is empty because we didn't change any files, and note
that one of the numeric portions of the clock string has changed.

Also note that the mergebase revision remains the same because we also didn't
rebase the commit yet.

This is a little white lie: the reality is that some files did change in the
version control system, and with the expression we're using we would see them,
but they are not part of the working copy so we're omitting them for the clarity
of this example.

Now if we rebase and update to the rebased revision (taking us to the last of
the illustrations from above), we'd run this query, feeding in the clock from
the last query to get the correct incremental result:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "since": {       "clock": "c:123:124",       "scm": {            "mergebase": "f12345",            "mergebase-with": "main"       }  },  "expression": ["type", "f"],  "fields": ["name"]}]EOT

we'd get this result:

    {   "clock": {       "clock": "c:123:125",       "scm": {            "mergebase": "fabf87",            "mergebase-with": "main"       }    },    "files": ["cat.jpg", "cats.cpp"]}

Note that the mergebase reported in the clock has changed and note that the list
of files reported is just the two from our commit stack despite there being
hundreds of files that were physically updated on the disk.

Your client can now lookup some state based on the `fabf87` revision and
download it, and can then incrementally apply the computation for `cat.jpg` and
`cats.cpp` on top of that state.

If your client doesn't know how to do this, then you shouldn't use this source
control aware query mode!

You can also use the same source control awareness in your subscriptions. This
is basically the same procedure as making queries above, but there are some
preconditions and things to note:

- Watchman needs the cooperation of the source control system to know when it
  should defer events.
- Source control aware subscriptions implicitly enable `defer_vcs` and
  `defer:["hg.update"]`. As with the point above, this is to ensure that you
  don't get notified about files changing during the working copy update
  operation; that would defeat the point of using source control awareness.

To initiate a source control aware subscription:

    ["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "mysubscriptionname", {  "fields": ["name"],  "since": {    "scm": {      "mergebase-with": "main"    }  }}]

You'll then receive subscription responses as files change; those responses will
contain _fat clock_ values for the `since` and `clock` fields:

    {  "subscription": "mysubscriptionname",  "clock": {    "clock": "c:1234:125",    "scm": {      "mergebase": "fabf87",      "mergebase-with": "main",    }  },  "since": {    "clock": "c:1234:123",    "scm": {      "mergebase": "f12345",      "mergebase-with": "main",    }  },  "files": ["cat.jpg", "cats.cpp"],  "root":  "/path/to/root"}

The `clock` field holds the value of the clock and the merge base as of the
subscription notification.

The `since` field holds the _fat clock_ that was returned in the `clock` field
from the prior subscription update. It is present as a convenience for you; you
can compare the `mergebase` fields between the two to determine that the merge
base changed in this update. This is an important detail because more files in
the working copy have been physically changed than are reflected in the `files`
list; your tooling will need to so something appropriate to ensure that it
computes a consistent and correct result.

& `state-leave` [​](#state-enter--state-leave "Direct link to heading")

Source control aware subscriptions will always include a _fat clock_ in their
responses, however, only the regular clock is provided in `state-enter` and
`state-leave` notifications. This is because computing the source control
information is a non-trivial operation and could increase latency.

Release Notes | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Watchman is continuously deployed inside Facebook, which means that we don't
explicitly maintain version numbers. We have automation that cuts a weekly tag
with a named derived from the date. You can learn more about how to reason about
supported _capabilities_ and our backwards compatibility guidelines in the
[Compatibility Rules](/watchman/docs/compatibility) docs.

We focus on the highlights only in these release notes. For a full history that
includes all of the gory details, please see
[the commit history on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/commits/main).

- Added script `watchman-replicate-subscription`. It can replicate an existing
  watchman subscription. Integrators can use this script to validate watchman
  notifications their client is receiving.
- Added support for suffix sets in suffix expressions. You now can specify
  multiple suffixes to match against by setting the second argument to a list of
  suffixes. See `suffix-set` documentation for
  [more details](/watchman/docs/expr/suffix#suffix-set)
- pywatchman: introduced new pywatchman\_aio client for python
- Windows: we no longer trust environment variables to locate the state
  directory which should result in a better experience for users that mix
  cygwin, mingw, native windows and/or WSL or other environments
- Windows: we now support unix domain sockets on Windows 10. The CLI will prefer
  to use unix domain sockets when available.

We weren't great at updating the release notes since the prior release; there
was a lot of work to support our sister project EdenFS that isn't broadly
relevant to those outside FB at the time of writing.

- New field: `content.sha1hex`. This field expands to the SHA1 hash of the file
  contents, expressed in hex digits (40 character hex string). Watchman
  maintains a cache of the content hashes and can compute the hash on demand and
  also heuristically as files are changed. This is useful for tooling that wants
  to perform more intelligent cache invalidation or build artifact fetching from
  content addressed storage.
- Experimental feature: Source Control Aware query mode. Currently supports only
  Mercurial (patches to add Git support are welcomed!). SCM aware query mode
  helps to keep response sizes closer to `O(what-you-changed)` than to
  `O(all-repo-changes)` when rebasing your code. Using this feature effectively
  may require some additional infrastructure to compute and associate data with
  revisions from your repo.
- Fixed an issue that resulted in the perf logging thread deadlocking when
  `perf_logger_command` is enabled in the global configuration
- Fixed an issue where queries larger than 1MB would likely result in a PDU
  error response.
- Reduced lock contention for subscriptions that do no use the advanced settling
  (`drop`, `defer`) options.
- Fixed `since` generator behavior when using unix timestamps rather than the
  preferred clock string syntax
- Improved the reporting of "new" files in watchman results
- Improved performance of handling changes on case insensitive filesystems
- Windows: promoted from alpha to beta status!
- Windows: fixed some performance and reliability issues
- Windows: now operates correctly on Windows 7
- Windows: can now see and report symlinks and junction points
- Windows: fixed potential deadlock in trigger deletion
- Windows: fixed stack trace rendering on win32
- Windows: improved IO scheduling around deletes on win32
- Windows: improved handling of case insensitive win32 driver letters
- pywatchman: the python wheel format is used for publishing watchman pypi
  package
- pywatchman: now watchman path is configurable in python client
- pywatchman: now python client can be used as a context manager
- Solaris: support for Solaris has been removed. If you'd like to commit to
  testing and maintaining Solaris support, we'd love to hear from you!

Whoops, we never got around to tagging this beyond a release candidate tag!

- New command `flush-subscriptions` to synchronize subscriptions associated with
  the current session.
- On Windows, return `/` as the directory separator. Previously we used `\`.
  This change should be pretty neutral for clients, and makes it easier to work
  with both the internals and the integration test infrastructure.
- Enforce socket Unix groups more strongly — Watchman will now refuse to start
  if it couldn't gain the right group memberships, as can happen for sites that
  are experiencing intermittent LDAP connectivity problems.
- pywatchman now officially supports Python 3. pywatchman will return Unicode
  strings (possibly with surrogate escapes) by default, but can optionally
  return bytestrings. Note that on Python 3, pywatchman requires Watchman 4.8
  and above. The Python 2 interface and requirements remain unchanged.
- Prior to 4.8, methods on the Java WatchmanClient that returned
  ListenableFutures would swallow exceptions and hang in an unfinished state
  under situations like socket closure or thread death. This has been fixed, and
  now ListenableFutures propagate exception conditions immediately. (Note that
  this is typically unrecoverable, and users should create a new WatchmanClient
  to re-establish communication with Watchman.) See #412.
- The minimum Java version for the Watchman Java client has always been 1.7, but
  it was incorrectly described to be 1.6. The Java client's build file has been
  fixed accordingly.
- Watchman was converted from C to C++. The conversion exposed several
  concurrency bugs, all of which have now been fixed.
- Subscription queries are now executed in the context of the client thread,
  which means that subscriptions are dispatched in parallel. Previously,
  subscriptions would be serially dispatched and block the disk IO thread.
- Triggers are now dispatched in parallel and waits are managed in their own
  threads (one thread per trigger). This improves concurrency and resolves a
  couple of waitpid related issues where watchman may not reap spawned children
  in a timely fashion, or may spin on CPU until another child is spawned.
- Fixed an object lifecycle management issue that could cause a crash when aging
  out old/transient files.
- Implement an upgraded wire protocol, BSERv2, on the server and in pywatchman.
  BSERv2 can carry information about string encoding over the wire. This lets
  pywatchman convert to Unicode strings on Python 3. Clients and servers know
  how to transparently fall back to BSERv1.
- OS X: we no longer use socket activation when registering with launchd. This
  was the source of some upgrade problems for mac Homebrew users.

- Reduced memory usage by 40%
- Queries can now run with a shared lock. It is recommended that clients move
  away from the `n:FOO` style server side named cursor clockspecs to take full
  advantage of this.
- Added new `glob` generator as a walking strategy for queries. This allows
  watchman to evaluate globs in the most efficient manner. Our friends in the
  Buck project have already integrated this into their `BUCK` file parsing to
  evaluate globs without touching the filesystem!
- Added `"case_sensitive": true` option to queries to force matches to happen in
  a case sensitive manner, even if the watched root is on a case insensitive
  filesystem. This is used to accelerate certain types of internal traversal: if
  we know that a path is case sensitive we can perform an `O(1)` lookup where we
  would otherwise have to perform an `O(number-of-directory-entries)` scan and
  compare.
- Fixed a race condition during subscription initiation that could emit
  incorrect clock values.
- Fixed spurious over-notification for parent directories of changed files on
  Mac.
- Fixed some reliability issues on Windows

- Improved I/O scheduling when processing recursive deletes and deep directory
  rename operations.
- Improved performance of the `ignore_dirs` configuration option on OS X and
  Windows systems. We take advantage of an undocumented (but supported!) API to
  further accelerate this for the first 8 entries in the `ignore_dirs` on OS X.
  Users that depend on this configuration to avoid recrawls will want to review
  and prioritize their most active build dirs to the front of the `ignore_dirs`
  specified in their `.watchmanconfig` file.
- Added an optional recrawl recovery strategy for OS X that will attempt to
  resync from the fseventsd journal rather than performing a full filesystem
  walk. This is currently disabled by default but will likely be enabled by
  default in the next Watchman release. You can enable this by setting
  `fsevents_try_resync: true` in either `/etc/watchman.json` or your
  `.watchmanconfig`. This should reduce the frequency of recrawl warnings for
  some users/workloads, and also improves I/O for users with extremely large
  trees.
- Fixed accidental exponential time complexity issue with recursive deletes and
  deep directory rename operations on case-insensitive filesystems (such as OS
  X). This manifested as high CPU utilization for extended periods of time.
- Added support for allowing non-owner access to a Watchman instance. Only the
  owner is authorized to create or delete watches. Non-owners can view
  information about existing watches. Access control is based on unix domain
  socket permissions. The new but not yet documented configuration options
  `sock_group` and `sock_access` can be used to control this new behavior.
- Added support for inetd-style socket activation of the watchman service.
  [this commit includes a sample configuration for systemd](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/commit/2985377eaf8c8538b28fae9add061b67991a87c2).
- Added the `symlink_target` field to the stored metadata for files. This holds
  the text of the symbolic link for symlinks. You can test whether it is
  supported by a watchman server using the capability name
  `field-symlink_target`.
- Fixed an issue where watchman may not reap child processes spawned by
  triggers.
- Fixed an issue where watchman may block forever during shutdown if there are
  other connected clients.
- Added `hint_num_dirs` configuration option.

(These changes have not yet been released to pypi)

- Added immutable version of data results to bser. This is cheaper to build from
  a serialized bser representation than the mutable version and is better suited
  to large result sets received from watchman.
- Fixed a number of misc. portability issues
- Added Python 3.x support

- Fixed an inotify race condition for non-atomic directory replacements that was
  introduced in Watchman 4.4.

- Added state-enter and state-leave commands can allow subscribers to more
  intelligently settle/coalesce events around hg update or builds.
- Fixed an issue where subscriptions could double-notify for the same events.
- Fixed an issue where subscriptions that never match any files add
  O(all-observed-files) CPU cost to every subscription dispatch

- Improved handling of case insensitive renames; halved the memory usage and
  doubled crawl speed on OS X.

- Increased strictness of checks for symlinks; rather than just checking whether
  the leaf of a directory tree is a symlink, we now check each component down
  from the root of the watch. This improves detection and processing for
  directory-to-symlink (and vice versa) transitions.
- Increased priority of the watchman process on OS X.

- Added `watchman-make` and `watchman-wait` commands
- Added pure python implementation of BSER

- Fixed an issue where symlink size was always reported as 0 on OS X using the
  new bulkstat functionality

- Fixed an issue where a directory that was replaced by a symlink would cause a
  symlink traversal instead of correctly updating the type of the node and
  marking the children removed.
- Fixed a debugging log line that was emitted at the wrong log level on every
  directory traversal.

- Fixed an issue where dir renames on OS X could cause us to lose track of the
  files inside the renamed dir
- Fixed an issue where dir deletes and replacements on Linux could cause us to
  lose track of the files inside the replaced dir (similar to the OS X issue
  above in manifestation, but a different root cause).
- Improved (re)crawl speed for dirs with more than a couple of entries on
  average (improvement can be up to 5x for dirs with up to 64 entries on
  average). You may now tune the `hint_num_files_per_dir` setting in your
  `.watchmanconfig` to better match your tree.
  [More details](/watchman/docs/config#hint_num_files_per_dir)
- Improved (re)crawl speed on OS X 10.10 and later by using `getattrlistbulk`.
  This allows us to improve the data:syscall ratio during crawling and can
  improve throughput by up to 40% for larger trees.
- Add optional `sync_timeout` to the `clock` command
- Avoid accidentally passing descriptors other than the stdio streams when we
  spawn the watchman service.
- Fixed a race condition where we could start two sets of watcher threads for
  the same dir if two clients issue a `watch` or `watch-project` at the same
  time
- Added a helpful error for a tmux + launchd issue on OS X

- Improved latency of processing kernel notifications. It should now be far less
  likely to run into an notification queue overflow.
- Improved idle behavior. There were a couple of places where watchman would
  wake up more often than was strictly needed and these have now been fixed.
  This is mostly of interest to laptop users on battery power.
- Improved inotify move tracking. Some move operations could cause watchman to
  become confused and trigger a recrawl. This has now been resolved.
- Hardened statedir and permissions. There was a possibility of a symlink attack
  and this has now been mitigated by re-structuring the statedir layout.
- Fixed a possible deadlock in the idle watch reaper
- Fixed an issue where the watchman -p log-level debug could drop log
  notifications in the CLI
- Disabled the IO-throttling-during-crawl that we added in 3.7. It proved to be
  more harmful than beneficial.
- `-j` CLI option now accepts either JSON or BSER encoded command on stdin
- Added [capabilities](/watchman/docs/capabilities) to the server, and added the
  [capabilityCheck](/watchman/docs/cmd/version#capabilityCheck) method to the
  python and node clients.

- Added the `capabilityCheck` method
- Added `SocketTimeout` exception to distinguish timeouts from protocol level
  exceptions

- Added the
  [capabilityCheck](/watchman/docs/nodejs#checking-for-watchman-availability)
  method.

- First official pypi release, thanks to [@kwlzn](https://github.com/kwlzn) for
  setting up the release machinery for this.

(Watchman 3.6.0 wasn't formally released)

- Fixed bug where `query match` on `foo*.java` with `wholename` scope would
  incorrectly match `foo/bar/baz.java`.
- Added `src/**/*.java` recursive glob pattern support to `query match`.
- Added options dictionary to `query`'s `match` operator.
- Added `includedotfiles` option to `query match` to include files whose names
  start with `.`.
- Added `noescape` option to `query match` to make `\` match literal `\`.
- We'll now automatically age out and stop watches. See
  [idle\_reap\_age\_seconds](/watchman/docs/config#idle_reap_age_seconds) for
  more information.
- `watch-project` will now try harder to re-use an existing watch and avoid
  creating an overlapping watch.
- Reduce I/O priority during crawling on systems that support this
- Fixed issue with the `long long` data type in the python BSER module

- Updated the node client to more gracefully handle `undefined` values in
  objects when serializing them; we now omit keys whose values are `undefined`
  rather than throw an exception.

- Fix the version number reported by watchman.

- `trigger` now supports an optional `relative_root` argument. The trigger is
  evaluated with respect to this subdirectory. See
  [trigger](/watchman/docs/cmd/trigger#relative-roots) for more.

- Updated the node client to handle 64-bit integer values using the
  [node-int64](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-int64). These are most likely
  to show up if your query fields include `size` and you have files larger than
  2GB in your watched root.

- Updated the node client to support [BSER](/watchman/docs/bser) encoding,
  fixing a quadratic performance issue in the JSON stream decoder that was used
  previously.

- `query` and `subscribe` now support an optional `relative_root` argument.
  Inputs and outputs are evaluated with respect to this subdirectory. See
  [File Queries](/watchman/docs/file-query#relative-roots) for more.

NodeJS | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

To install the nodejs client:

    $ npm install fb-watchman

and to import it and create a client instance:

    var watchman = require('fb-watchman');var client = new watchman.Client();

This documentation assumes that you are using the latest available version of
the `fb-watchman` package published to the npm repository.

The client can be installed without requiring that the service is installed. It
is important to handle lack of availability and also to test whether the
installed service supports the [capabilities](/watchman/docs/capabilities)
required by your application.

The `capabilityCheck` method issues a [version](/watchman/docs/cmd/version)
command to query the capabilities of the server.

    var watchman = require('fb-watchman');var client = new watchman.Client();client.capabilityCheck({optional:[], required:['relative_root']},  function (error, resp) {    if (error) {      // error will be an Error object if the watchman service is not      // installed, or if any of the names listed in the `required`      // array are not supported by the server      console.error(error);    }    // resp will be an extended version response:    // {'version': '3.8.0', 'capabilities': {'relative_root': true}}    console.log(resp);  });

Almost every operation in watchman revolves around watching a directory tree.
You can repeatedly ask to watch the same directory without error; watchman will
re-use an existing watch.

    var watchman = require('fb-watchman');var client = new watchman.Client();var dir_of_interest = "/some/path";client.capabilityCheck({optional:[], required:['relative_root']},  function (error, resp) {    if (error) {      console.log(error);      client.end();      return;    }    // Initiate the watch    client.command(['watch-project', dir_of_interest],      function (error, resp) {        if (error) {          console.error('Error initiating watch:', error);          return;        }        // It is considered to be best practice to show any 'warning' or        // 'error' information to the user, as it may suggest steps        // for remediation        if ('warning' in resp) {          console.log('warning: ', resp.warning);        }        // `watch-project` can consolidate the watch for your        // dir_of_interest with another watch at a higher level in the        // tree, so it is very important to record the `relative_path`        // returned in resp        console.log('watch established on ', resp.watch,                    ' relative_path', resp.relative_path);      });  });

Most node applications are interested in subscribing to live file change
notifications. In watchman these are configured by issuing a
[subscribe](/watchman/docs/cmd/subscribe) command. A subscription is valid for
the duration of your client connection, or until you cancel the subscription
using the [unsubscribe](/watchman/docs/cmd/unsubscribe) command.

The following will generate subscription results for all files in the tree that
match the query expression and then generate subscription results as files
change:

    // `watch` is obtained from `resp.watch` in the `watch-project` response.// `relative_path` is obtained from `resp.relative_path` in the// `watch-project` response.function make_subscription(client, watch, relative_path) {  sub = {    // Match any `.js` file in the dir_of_interest    expression: ["allof", ["match", "*.js"]],    // Which fields we're interested in    fields: ["name", "size", "mtime_ms", "exists", "type"]  };  if (relative_path) {    sub.relative_root = relative_path;  }  client.command(['subscribe', watch, 'mysubscription', sub],    function (error, resp) {      if (error) {        // Probably an error in the subscription criteria        console.error('failed to subscribe: ', error);        return;      }      console.log('subscription ' + resp.subscribe + ' established');    });  // Subscription results are emitted via the subscription event.  // Note that this emits for all subscriptions.  If you have  // subscriptions with different `fields` you will need to check  // the subscription name and handle the differing data accordingly.  // `resp`  looks like this in practice:  //  // { root: '/private/tmp/foo',  //   subscription: 'mysubscription',  //   files: [ { name: 'node_modules/fb-watchman/index.js',  //       size: 4768,  //       exists: true,  //       type: 'f' } ] }  client.on('subscription', function (resp) {    if (resp.subscription !== 'mysubscription') return;    resp.files.forEach(function (file) {      // convert Int64 instance to javascript integer      const mtime_ms = +file.mtime_ms;      console.log('file changed: ' + file.name, mtime_ms);    });  });}

The example above will generate results for existing (and deleted!) files at the
time that the subscription is established. In some applications this can be
undesirable. The following example shows how to add a logical time constraint.

watchman tracks changes using an [abstract clock](/watchman/docs/clockspec).
We'll determine the current clock at the time that we initiate the watch and
then add that as a constraint in our subscription.

    function make_time_constrained_subscription(client, watch, relative_path) {  client.command(['clock', watch], function (error, resp) {    if (error) {      console.error('Failed to query clock:', error);      return;    }    sub = {      // Match any `.js` file in the dir_of_interest      expression: ["allof", ["match", "*.js"]],      // Which fields we're interested in      fields: ["name", "size", "exists", "type"],      // add our time constraint      since: resp.clock    };    if (relative_path) {      sub.relative_root = relative_path;    }    client.command(['subscribe', watch, 'mysubscription', sub],      function (error, resp) {        // handle the result here      });  });}

The `capabilityCheck` method issues a [version](/watchman/docs/cmd/version)
command to query the capabilities of the server.

If the server doesn't support capabilities, `capabilityCheck` will emulate the
capability response for a handful of significant capabilities based on the
version reported by the server.

The `options` argument may contain the following properties:

- `optional` an array listing optional capability names
- `required` an array listing required capability names

The properties are passed through to the underlying `version` command.

The `done` parameter is a callback that will be passed (error, result) when the
command completes. It doesn't make sense to issue a `capabilityCheck` call and
not provide the `done` callback.

The response object will contain a `capabilities` object property whose keys
will be the union of the `optional` and `required` capability names and whose
values will be either `true` or `false` depending on the availability of the
capability name.

If any of the `required` capabilities are not supported by the server, the
`error` parameter in the `done` callback will be set and will contain a
meaningful error message.

    client.capabilityCheck({optional:[], required:['relative_root']},  function (error, resp) {    if (error) {      // error will be an Error object if the watchman service is not      // installed, or if any of the names listed in the `required`      // array are not supported by the server      console.error(error);    }    // resp will be an extended version response:    // {'version': '3.8.0', 'capabilities': {'relative_root': true}}    console.log(resp);  });

Sends a command to the watchman service. `args` is an array that specifies the
command name and any optional arguments. The command is queued and dispatched
asynchronously. You may queue multiple commands to the service; they will be
dispatched in FIFO order once the client connection is established.

The `done` parameter is a callback that will be passed (error, result) when the
command completes. You may omit it if you are not interested in the result of
the command.

    client.command(['watch-project', process.cwd()], function(error, resp) {  if (error) {    console.log('watch failed: ', error);    return;  }  if ('warning' in resp) {    console.log('warning: ', resp.warning);  }  if ('relative_path' in resp) {    // We will need to remember and adjust for relative_path    console.log('watching project ', resp.watch, ' relative path to cwd is ',      resp.relative_path);  } else {    console.log('watching ', resp.watch);  }});

If a field named `warning` is present in `resp`, the watchman service is trying
to communicate an issue that the user should see and address. For example, if
the system watch resources need adjustment, watchman will provide information
about this and how to remediate the issue. It is suggested that tools that build
on top of this library bubble the warning message up to the user.

Terminates the connection to the watchman service. Does not wait for any queued
commands to send.

The following events are emitted by the watchman client object:

Emitted when the client successfully connects to the watchman service

Emitted when the socket to the watchman service encounters an error.

It may also be emitted prior to establishing a connection if we are unable to
successfully execute the watchman CLI binary to determine how to talk to the
server process.

It is passed a variable that encapsulates the error.

Emitted when the socket to the watchman service is closed

Emitted in response to a unilateral `log` PDU from the watchman service. To
enable these, you need to send a `log-level` command to the service:

    // This is very verbose, you probably don't want to do thisclient.command(['log-level', 'debug']);client.on('log', function(info) {  console.log(info);});

Emitted in response to a unilateral `subscription` PDU from the watchman
service. To enable these, you need to send a `subscribe` command to the service:

    // Subscribe to notifications about .js files  client.command(['subscribe', process.cwd(), 'mysubscription', {      expression: ["match", "*.js"]    }],    function(error, resp) {      if (error) {        // Probably an error in the subscription criteria        console.log('failed to subscribe: ', error);        return;      }      console.log('subscription ' + resp.subscribe + ' established');    }  );  // Subscription results are emitted via the subscription event.  // Note that watchman will deliver a list of all current files  // when you first subscribe, so you don't need to walk the tree  // for yourself on startup  client.on('subscription', function(resp) {    console.log(resp.root, resp.subscription, resp.files);  });

To cancel a subscription, use the `unsubscribe` command and pass in the name of
the subscription you want to cancel:

    client.command(['unsubscribe', process.cwd(), 'mysubscription']);

Note that subscriptions names are scoped to your connection to the watchman
service; multiple different clients can use the same subscription name without
fear of colliding.

Installation | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Watchman is known to compile and pass its test suite on:

- Linux systems with \`inotify\`
- macOS (uses \`FSEvents\` on 10.7+, \`kqueue(2)\` on earlier versions)
- Windows 10 (64-bit) and up. Windows 7 support is provided by community patches

Watchman used to support the following systems, but no one is actively
maintaining them. The core of the code should be OK, but they likely don't
build. We'd love it if someone would step forward to maintain them:

- BSDish systems (FreeBSD 9.1, OpenBSD 5.2) that have the `kqueue(2)` facility
- Illumos and Solaris style systems that have `port_create(3C)`

Watchman relies on the operating system facilities for file notification, which
means that you will likely have very poor results using it on any kind of remote
or distributed filesystem.

Watchman does not currently support any other operating system not covered by
the list above.

1. Download and extract the windows release from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
2. It will be named something like `watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-windows.zip`
3. It contains a `bin` folder. Move that somewhere appropriate and update your
   `PATH` environment to reference that location.

If you encounter issues with the Windows version of watchman, please report them
via GitHub!
[You can find the list of known Windows issues here](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+Windows).

Watchman is available via the
[Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/watchman) Windows package
manager. Installation is as simple as:

    PS C:\> choco install watchman

The package is maintained by the community rather than by Meta, so if you
experience issues with installation or uninstallation, you should
[contact the package maintainers](https://chocolatey.org/packages/watchman/ContactOwners)
for assistance.

Homebrew[​](#-homebrew "Direct link to heading")

Homebrew's [Watchman package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/watchman#default)
is community-maintained, but it works well for many.

    $ brew update$ brew install watchman

If for some reason you can't wait for the Homebrew package to update, you can
install the latest build from GitHub:

    $ brew install --HEAD watchman

MacPorts[​](#-macports "Direct link to heading")

To install the package maintained by
[MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/watchman/):

    $ sudo port install watchman

1. Download and extract the macOS release from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
2. It will be named something like `watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-macos.zip`

   $ unzip watchman-_-macos.zip$ cd watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-macos$ sudo mkdir -p
   /usr/local/{bin,lib} /usr/local/var/run/watchman$ sudo cp bin/_
   /usr/local/bin$ sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib$ sudo chmod 755
   /usr/local/bin/watchman$ sudo chmod 2777 /usr/local/var/run/watchman

The Watchman binaries are not signed, so manual approval in Security & Privacy
in System Preferences may be necessary.

If you use Homebrew on Linux, it's a great way to get a recent Watchman build.

Follow the [macOS instructions above](#homebrew-instructions).

**Warning**: Do not install the Fedora-supplied Watchman package. It is old and
missing security, bug, and performance fixes.

1. From the
   [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest),
   download the .rpm corresponding to your Fedora version
2. `sudo dnf localinstall watchman-$VERSION.fc$FEDORA_VERSION.x86_64.rpm`
3. Confirm successful installation by running `watchman version`

**Warning**: Do not install the Ubuntu-supplied Watchman package. It is old and
missing security, bug, and performance fixes.

1. From the
   [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest),
   download the .deb corresponding to your Ubuntu version
2. `sudo dpkg -i watchman_$UBUNTU_RELEASE_$VERSION.deb`
3. You will likely see errors about unresolved dependencies. The next step will
   resolve them.
4. `sudo apt-get -f install`
5. Confirm successful installation by running `watchman version`

Building from Source[​](#-building-from-source "Direct link to heading")

Download a
[source snapshot from the latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
or [clone from GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/).

    $ cd watchman# Ensure Cargo is installed. Either through your OS's package manager or https://rustup.rs/$ cargo version# Optionally, to save time, you can ask Watchman's build process to install system dependencies$ sudo ./install-system-packages.sh$ ./autogen.sh

**Note**: Our binaries are built from the main branch only. We don't provide
binaries for v4.9.0.

**Note**: The Linux binaries are compiled on a GitHub Action VM (ubuntu-20.04 at
the time of this writing), and Linux binaries are
[not generally compatible across distributions](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/1019),
so try the prebuilt Fedora, Ubuntu, or Homebrew packages first.

Watchman is continuously deployed as it passes our internal test validation
inside Meta and doesn't use manually assigned or "approved" version numbers.

Outside Meta we have automation that cuts a tag and builds binaries on Monday of
each week and assigns a tag based on the date. That process is in a beta state;
some or all of the binaries may not be present for any given tag.

1. Download and extract the release for your system from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
2. It will be named something like `watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-linux.zip`

   $ unzip watchman-_-linux.zip$ cd watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-linux$ sudo mkdir -p
   /usr/local/{bin,lib} /usr/local/var/run/watchman$ sudo cp bin/_
   /usr/local/bin$ sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib$ sudo chmod 755
   /usr/local/bin/watchman$ sudo chmod 2777 /usr/local/var/run/watchman

The `inotify(7)` subsystem has three important tunings that impact watchman.

- `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances` impacts how many different root dirs
  you can watch.
- `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` impacts how many dirs you can watch
  across all watched roots.
- `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events` impacts how likely it is that your
  system will experience a notification overflow.

You obviously need to ensure that `max_user_instances` and `max_user_watches`
are set so that the system is capable of keeping track of your files.

`max_queued_events` is important to size correctly; if it is too small, the
kernel will drop events and watchman won't be able to report on them. Making
this value bigger reduces the risk of this happening.

Watchman has two simple strategies for mitigating an overflow of
`max_queued_events`:

- It uses a dedicated thread to consume kernel events as quickly as possible
- When the kernel reports an overflow, watchman will assume that all the files
  have been modified and will re-crawl the directory tree as though it had just
  started watching the dir.

This means that if an overflow does occur, you won't miss a legitimate change
notification, but instead will get spurious notifications for files that haven't
actually changed.

_Only applicable on macOS 10.6 and earlier_

The default per-process descriptor limit on macOS is extremely low (256!).

Watchman will attempt to raise its descriptor limit to match
`kern.maxfilesperproc` when it starts up, so you shouldn't need to mess with
`ulimit`; just raising the sysctl should do the trick.

The following will raise the limits to allow 10 million files total, with 1
million files per process until your next reboot.

    $ sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=10485760$ sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576

Putting the following into a file named `/etc/sysctl.conf` on macOS will cause
these values to persist across reboots:

    kern.maxfiles=10485760kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query

File Queries | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Watchman file queries consist of 1 or more _generators_ that feed files through
the _expression evaluator_.

Generators are analogous to the list of _paths_ that you specify when using the
`find(1)` utility, but are implemented in watchman with a bit of a twist because
watchman doesn't need to crawl the filesystem in realtime and instead maintains
a couple of indexes over the tree.

A query may specify any number of generators; each generator will emit its list
of files and this may mean that you see the same file output more than once if
you specified the use of multiple generators that all produce the same file.

Watchman provides 5 generators:

- **since**: produces a list of files that were modified since a specific
  clockspec.
- **suffix**: produces a list of files that have a particular suffix.
- **glob**: efficiently pattern match a list of files based on their names.
- **path**: produces a list of files based on their path and depth.
- **all**: produces a list of all known files

_Since 4.7._

If your query uses multiple generators, or configures the `path` generator with
paths that yield multiple results, the default behavior (for backwards
compatibility reasons) is to emit those duplicate results in the query output.

You may ask Watchman to de-duplicate results for you by enabling the
`dedup_results` boolean in your query:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "path": ["bar", "bar"],  "dedup_results": true}]EOT

You may test for this feature using an extended version command and requesting
the capability name `dedup_results`.

The `since` generator produces a list of files that were modified since a
specific [clockspec](/watchman/docs/clockspec).

The following query will consider the set of files changed since the last query
using the named cursor `mycursor` and then pass them to the expression evaluator
to be filtered to just those that are files:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "since": "n:mycursor",  "expression": ["type", "f"]}]EOT

If the `since` parameter value is blank, was produced by a different watchman
process (in other words, the watchman process was restarted between the time
that the value was obtained and the time the query was issued) or is a named
cursor that has not yet been used in a query, the `since` generator will
consider the state to be a _fresh instance_ and its behavior is modified:

A _fresh instance_ result set will only include files that currently exist and
will generate file nodes that are always considered to be `new`.

If the query was configured with the `empty_on_fresh_instance` property set to
`true` then the result set will be empty and the `is_fresh_instance` property
will be set to `true` in the result object.

The since generator also knows how to talk to source control;
[you can read more about that here](/watchman/docs/scm-query).

The `since` generator does not consider the targets of symlinks. In particular,
the `since` generator may _not_ produce a symlink in the following cases:

- The symlink's target was a file, and the file is since modified.
- The symlink's target was a file, and the file is since deleted or replaced
  with a different file.
- An ancestor of the symlink's target was created or deleted or modified.
- The symlink's target was a directory, and a file is since added or removed
  from that directory.

The `suffix` generator produces a list of files that have a particular suffix or
set of suffixes. The value can be either a string or an array of strings.

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "suffix": "js"}]EOT

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "suffix": ["js", "css"]}]EOT

If the `suffix` generator is given an empty array, it produces no files.

The `suffix` generator can produce symlinks.

The `suffix` generator does not follow symlinks. For example, a symlink to
`/etc` will not cause a `"suffix": "conf"` query to search within `/etc` and
produce `/etc/resolv.conf`.

_Since 4.7._

The `glob` generator produces a list of files by matching against your input
list of patterns. It does this by building a tree from the glob expression(s)
and walking both the expression and the in-memory filesystem tree concurrently.

This query will yield a list of all of the C source and header files found
directly in the `src` dir:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "glob": ["src/*.c", "src/*.h"],  "fields": ["name"]}]

This query will yield a list of all of the C source and header files found in
any subdirectories of the root:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "glob": ["**/*.c", "**/*.h"],  "fields": ["name"]}]

Note that it is more efficient to use the `suffix` generator together with a
`dirname` expression term for such a broadly scoped query as it results in fewer
comparisons. This example is included as an illustration of recursive globbing.

The glob generator implicitly enables `dedup_results` mode.

If the `glob` generator is given an empty array, it produces no files.

The `glob` generator can produce symlinks.

The `glob` generator does not follow symlinks. For example, a symlink to `/etc`
will not cause a `"glob": ["**/resolv.conf"]` query to search within `/etc` and
produce `/etc/resolv.conf`.

The `path` generator produces a list of files based on their path and depth.
Depth controls how far watchman will search down the directory tree for files.

The `path` generator expects an array of path specifiers. Each path specifier
can be either a string or an object and each will produce a set of files.

If it is a string then it is treated as the value for `path` with `depth` set to
infinite. If an object, the fields `path` (a string) and `depth` (an integer)
must be supplied.

Paths are relative to the root, so if watchman is watching `/foo/`, path `bar`
refers to `/foo/bar`.

A `depth` value of `0` means only files and directories which are contained in
this path. A `depth` value of `-1` means no limit on the depth.

The following `path` generators are equivalent:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "path": ["bar"]}]EOT

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "path": [{"path": "bar", "depth": -1}]}]EOT

If the `path` generator is given an empty array, it produces no files.

The `path` generator can produce symlinks.

The `path` generator does not follow symlinks.

The `all` generator produces a list of all file nodes. It is the default
generator and is used in the case where no other generators were explicitly
specified.

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {}]EOT

The `all` generator can produce symlinks.

The `all` generator does not follow symlinks.

A watchman query expression consists of 0 or more expression terms. If no terms
are provided then each file evaluated is considered a match (equivalent to
specifying a single `true` expression term).

Otherwise, the expression is evaluated against the file and produces a boolean
result. If that result is true then the file is considered a match and is added
to the output set.

An expression term is canonically represented as a JSON array whose zeroth
element is a string containing the term name.

    ["termname", arg1, arg2]

If the term accepts no arguments you may use a short form that consists of just
the term name expressed as a string:

    "true"

Expressions that match against file names may match against either the
_basename_ or the _wholename_ of the file. The basename is the name of the file
within its containing directory. The wholename is the name of the file relative
to the watched root.

You can find a list of all possible expression terms in the sidebar on the left
of this page.

_Since 3.3._

Watchman supports optionally evaluating queries with respect to a path within a
watched root. This is used with the `relative_root` parameter:

    ["query", "/path/to/watched/root", {  "relative_root": "project1",}]

Setting a relative root results in the following modifications to queries:

- The `path` generator is evaluated with respect to the relative root. In the
  above example, `"path": ["dir"]` will return all files inside
  `/path/to/watched/root/project1/dir`.
- The input expression is evaluated with respect to the relative root. In the
  above example, `"expression": ["match", "dir/*.txt", "wholename"]` will return
  all files inside `/path/to/watched/root/project1/dir/` that match the glob
  `*.txt`.
- Paths inside the relative root are returned with the relative root stripped
  off. For example, a path `project1/dir/file.txt` would be returned as

- Paths outside the relative root are not returned.

Relative roots behave similarly to a separate Watchman watch on the
subdirectory, without any of the system overhead that that imposes. This is
useful for large repositories, where your script or tool is only interested in a
particular directory inside the repository.

suffix | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The `suffix` expression evaluates true if the file suffix matches the second
argument. This matches files name `foo.php` and `foo.PHP` but not `foophp`:

    ["suffix", "php"]

Suffix expression matches are case insensitive.

_Since 5.0_

You may specify multiple suffixes to match against by setting the second
argument to an array:

    ["suffix", ["php", "css", "html"]]

This second form can be accelerated and is preferred over an `anyof`
construction. In the following example the two terms are functionally equivalent
but the set form has a more efficient and thus faster runtime:

    ["anyof", ["suffix", "php"], ["suffix", "html"]]["suffix", ["php", "html"]]

The [capability](/watchman/docs/capabilities) name associated with this enhanced
functionality is `suffix-set`.

size | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The size term allows the size of an existing file (not deleted) to be evaluated
using simple relational operators as described in the table below.

The size term must always be an array with 3 elements:

    ["size", "gt", 0]

The second parameter describes the relational operator and the third parameter
is the integer _operand_ to compare against. The example above evaluates to
`true` if the file exists and its size is greater than zero.

Possible relational operators are:

Operator

`eq`

Equal

`true` if file exists and `size == operand`

`ne`

Not Equal

`true` if file exists and `size != operand`

`gt`

`true` if file exists and `size > operand`

`ge`

Greater Than Or Equal

`true` if file exists and `size >= operand`

generator; when used as an expression term we are performing a straight
clockspec comparison. When used as a generator, candidate files are selected
based on the `since` time index. The end result might or might not be the
same--in particular, if the `since` time index is not passed in, it will be
treated the same as a fresh instance, and only files that exist will be
returned. The efficiency can vary based on the size and shape of the file tree
that you are watching; it may be cheaper to generate the candidate set of files
by suffix and then check the modification time if many files were changed since
your last query.

This will yield a true value if the observed change time is more recent than the
specified clockspec (this is equivalent to specifying "oclock" as the third
parameter):

    ["since", "c:12345:234"]

You may specify particular fields from the filesystem metadata. In this case
your clockspec should be a unix time value:

    ["since", 12345668, "mtime"] ["since", 12345668, "ctime"]

You may explicitly request the observed clock values too; in these cases we'll
accept either a timestamp or a clock value. The `oclock` is the last observed
change clock value (observed clock) and the `cclock` is the clock value where we
first observed the file come into existence (created clock):

    ["since", 12345668, "oclock"] ["since", "c:1234:123", "oclock"] ["since", 12345668, "cclock"] ["since", "c:1234:2342", "cclock"]

pcre & ipcre | Watchman

!

The `pcre` expression performs a Perl Compatible Regular Expression match
against the basename of the file. This pattern matches `test_plan.php` but not
`mytest_plan`:

    ["pcre", "^test_"]

You may optionally provide a third argument to change the scope of the match
from the basename to the wholename of the file.

    ["pcre", "txt", "basename"]["pcre", "txt", "wholename"]

`pcre` is case sensitive; for case insensitive matching use `ipcre` instead; it
behaves identically to `pcre` except that the match is performed ignoring case.

_Since 2.9.9._

Starting in version 2.9.9, on macOS systems where the watched root is a case
insensitive filesystem (this is the common case for macOS), `pcre` is equivalent
to `ipcre`.

_Since 4.7._

You can override the case sensitivity of all name matching operations used in
the query by setting the `case_sensitive` field in your query.

You may change the scope of the match via the optional third argument:

    ["name", "path/to/file.txt", "wholename"]["name", ["path/to/one", "path/to/two"], "wholename"]

Finally, you may specify case insensitive evaluation by using `iname` instead of
`name`.

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/expr/match

match & imatch | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The `match` expression performs a glob-style match against the basename of the
file, evaluating true if the match is successful.

    ["match", "*.txt"]

You may optionally provide a third argument to change the scope of the match
from the basename to the wholename of the file.

    ["match", "*.txt", "basename"]["match", "dir/*.txt", "wholename"]

`match` is case sensitive; for case insensitive matching use `imatch` instead;
it behaves identically to `match` except that the match is performed ignoring
case.

_Since 2.9.9._

On systems where the watched root is a case insensitive filesystem (this is the
common case for macOS and Windows), `match` is equivalent to `imatch`.

_Since 4.7._

You can override the case sensitivity of all name matching operations used in
the query by setting the `case_sensitive` field in your query.

_Since 3.7._

The `match` expression has been enhanced as described below. The
[capability](/watchman/docs/capabilities) name associated with this enhanced
functionality is `wildmatch`.

If you want to recursively match all files under a directory, use the `**` glob
operator along with the `wholename` scope:

    ["match", "src/**/*.java", "wholename"]

By default, paths whose names start with `.` are not included. To change this
behavior, you may optionally provide a fourth argument containing a dictionary
of flags:

    ["match", "*.txt", "basename", {"includedotfiles": true}]

By default, backslashes in the pattern escape the next character, so `\*`
matches a literal `*` character. To change this behavior so backslashes are
treated literally, set the `noescape` flag to `true` in the flags dictionary.
(Note that `\\` is a literal `\` in JSON notation):

    ["match", "*\\*.txt", "filename", {"noescape": true}]

matches `a\b.txt`.

dirname & idirname | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The `dirname` term allows matching on the parent directory structure for a given
file.

For the examples below, given a file with a wholename (the relative path from
the project root) of `foo/bar/baz`, the dirname portion is `foo/bar`.

The following two terms will match any file whose dirname is either exactly a
match for `foo/bar` or is any child directory of `foo/bar`. The first of these
two is a shortcut for the second:

    ["dirname", "foo/bar"]  ["dirname", "foo/bar", ["depth", "ge", 0]]

The second of those terms uses a relational expression based on the depth of the
file within the specified dirname. A file is considered to have `depth == 0` if
it is contained directly within the specified dirname. It has `depth == 1` if it
is contained in a direct child directory of the specified dirname, `depth == 2`
if it is contained in a grand-child directory and so on.

The relational expression accepts the same relational operators as described in
the [size term](/watchman/docs/expr/size).

If you wanted to match only files that were directly in the `foo/bar` dir:

    ["dirname", "foo/bar", ["depth", "eq", 0]]

If you wanted to match only files that were in a grand-child or deeper:

    ["dirname", "foo/bar", ["depth", "ge", 2]]

`idirname` is the case insensitive version of `dirname`. If the watched root is
detected as a case insensitive fileystem, `dirname` is equivalent to `idirname`.

C++ Client | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 4.8._

Watchman includes a C++ client library to facilitate easy access to Watchman
data from C++ applications. This library provides APIs for:

- Opening and maintaining a connection to a local Watchman server.
- Executing request-response Watchman commands.
- Subscribing to updates with in directory trees.

Provided the Folly library is present when Watchman is built, the C++ client
library is automatically built and installed. For details on building Watchman
see [Installation](/watchman/docs/install).

The public Watchman C++ client API is entirely covered in the installed
`watchman/WatchmanClient.h` header file. This header contains a usage synopsis
and notes on the public API features.

For a simple example of API usage, sending simple request-response commands to
Watchman, see `cppclient/CLI.cpp` in the Watchman source tree. For a more
extensive example of the API including use of subscriptions, see the integration
test `integration/cppclient.cpp` also in the Watchman source.

The C++ client library and its API make heavy use of the Folly library and as
such familiarity with this is highly recommended. Specifically, the client
library makes extensive use of
[Folly's async features](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/io/async/README.md)
to provide high-performance asynchronous I/O, and
[Folly's dynamics](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/Dynamic.md)
to avoid needing to construct/process raw JSON in C++.

To facilitate integration into your application's build, the Watchman C++ client
library provides support for
[pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/).

For example, if your application was contained entirely in one C++ file called
`app.cpp` the following would be sufficient for build on a system with GNU Make:

    $ make LDFLAGS=$(pkg-config watchmanclient --libs) CPPFLAGS=$(pkg-config watchmanclient --cflags) app

If Watchman is installed in a location `pkg-config` does not search for packages
by default, you may need to modify the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
For example:

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<watchman path>/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/cookies

[Skip to main content](#)

A file system monitor needs to make sure that queries see up-to-date views.
Watchman ensures that by creating a unique _cookie_ for each query made to it.

Consider a directory tree traversal to gather file status, such as the one
performed by `hg status` or `git status`. The traversal will race with any
operations happening concurrently, and this is impossible to fix. However, we do
get some weaker guarantees:

1. Every file operation that happens before the traversal is started will be
   observed.
2. File operations that happen after the traversal is started may or may not be
   observed.

For watchman, cookies enable us to provide similar guarantees. For a given
watchman query:

1. Every file operation that happens before the query is started will be
   observed.
2. File operations that happen after the query is started may or may not be
   observed.

A _cookie_ is a temporary file that is created inside a directory observed by
watchman. The cookie is created in a directory that is expected not to go away.
The obvious location is the root itself, but we'd like cookies not to show up in
VCS operations. So if a VCS directory (`.git`, `.hg` or `.svn`) is found, that's
where cookies are created instead.

The cookie is created while the root is locked, so watchman won't find the
cookie by accident while processing events from a prior run.

Once the cookie is created, the calling thread waits on a condition variable
guarded by the root's lock. This causes the lock to be released, and the root's
notify thread can now read events as usual.

When the notify thread finds that it is processing a cookie, it will signal its
respective condition variable. Importantly, this does not wake the calling
thread up immediately: since the notify thread still holds the root lock, the
calling thread will only be able to proceed once the notify thread releases the
lock.

_What do cookies get us?_

File monitoring systems like `inotify` typically provide an ordering guarantee:
notifications arrive in the order they happen. Any events happening before the
cookie is created will appear before the event for the cookie does, which means
they will be processed by the time the query is answered.

_How well do cookies work?_

The Mercurial test suite has proved to be a good stress test for watchman.
Before cookies were implemented, if 16 or more tests from the suite were run in
parallel, watchman would start falling behind and often produce outdated
answers. Cookies have successfully eradicated that.

_Can watchman find a cookie even if not all events leading to its appearance
have been processed?_

Consider this situation when cookies are created inside `.hg`:

1. Event A happens that would cause `.hg` to be read recursively
2. Event B happens that touches a file `subdir/foo`
3. A cookie is created inside `.hg`, causing event C
4. Event A is read from the OS file notification system but not events B and C
5. The cookie is found but `subdir/foo` is never read.

On Linux, to prevent this from happening, watchman will only consider a cookie
to be found if it is directly returned via OS notifications. The only exception
to this is during the initial crawl or a recrawl, when the cookie directory
isn't being watched yet.

On other platforms, this becomes more complicated because the respective
monitoring system only tells us that something inside a directory was created,
not what was created. This is currently an unresolved issue.

On macOS, Watchman uses
[FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events)
to monitor filesystem changes. Watchman uses a combination of cookie files
described above and
[FSEventStreamFlushSync](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/1445629-fseventstreamflushsync)
to attempt to catch up with all prior changes.

Unfortunately, in high-load situations like a large `git checkout` on a busy
host, we have observed that FSEvents from the `git checkout` may be received
after the cookie file notification and FSEventStreamFlushSync returning.

It turns out that FSEvents provides no guarantees here, and relying on it for
query synchronization is unsupported on any current Apple platform. Their
suggested workaround is to implement a watcher with
[Endpoint Security](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity).
Nobody has evaluated the feasibility of this yet.

In the meantime, you can set a `settle_period` and `settle_timeout` on the
query. Both are integer milliseconds, and `settle_period` specifies the required
quiescence before the watcher is considered caught up.

The idea was originally proposed by Matt Mackall
[mpm@selenic.com](mailto:mpm@selenic.com).

If you're thinking of hacking on watchman we'd love to hear from you! Feel free
to use the GitHub issue tracker and pull requests discuss and submit code
changes.

We (Facebook) have to ask for a "Contributor License Agreement" from someone who
sends in a patch or code that we want to include in the codebase. This is a
legal requirement; a similar situation applies to Apache and other ASF projects.

If we ask you to fill out a CLA we'll direct you to
[our online CLA page](https://code.facebook.com/cla) where you can complete it
easily. We use the same form as the Apache CLA so that friction is minimal.

Facebook Open Source provides a Code of Conduct statement for all projects to
follow, to promote a welcoming and safe open source community. Please
[read the full text](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct) so that you can
understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

You need to be able to build watchman from source and run its test suite. You
will need:

- python
- automake
- autoconf
- cmake
- libtool (or glibtool on macOS)
- libpcre
- libfolly (only needed if building the cppclient library)
- nodejs (for fb-watchman)

The build time dependencies can be installed by running
`getdeps.py --install-deps`. This is run for you when you run `autogen.sh` in
the example below:

    $ git clone https://github.com/facebook/watchman.git$ cd watchman$ ./autogen.sh$ make

After making a change, run the integration tests to make sure that things are
still working well before you submit your pull request:

    $ make integration

We'll probably ask you to augment the test suite to cover the functionality that
you're adding or changing.

Please keep in mind that our versioning philosophy in Watchman is to provide an
_append only_ API. If you're changing functionality, we'll ask you to do so in
such a way that it won't break older clients of Watchman.

If you're changing or adding new functionality, we'll ask you to also update the
documentation. You will need `ruby` 2.0.0 or later to preview the documentation.

One time setup:

    $ cd website$ sudo gem install bundler$ sudo bundler install

Then:

    $ jekyll serve -w -t

This will print out a URL that you can open in your browser to preview your

Configuration Files | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Watchman looks for configuration files in two places:

- The global configuration file `/etc/watchman.json`
- The root specific configuration file `.watchmanconfig`

When watching a root, if a valid JSON file named `.watchmanconfig` is present in
the root directory, watchman will load it and use it as a source of
configuration information specific to that root.

The global configuration path can be changed by passing the `--enable-conffile`
option to configure when you build watchman. This documentation refers to it as
`/etc/watchman.json` throughout, just be aware that your particular installation
may locate it elsewhere. In addition, the environmental variable
`$WATCHMAN_CONFIG_FILE` will override the default location.

If the global configuration file does not exist, Watchman will fall back on that
path with ".default" appended (e.g. /etc/watchman.json.default). This allows the
Watchman system package to provide different configuration defaults, like
setting enforce\_root\_files to true.

Changes to the `.watchmanconfig` or `/etc/watchman.json` files are not picked up
automatically; you will need to remove and re-add the watch (for
`.watchmanconfig`) or restart watchman (for `/etc/watchman.json`) for those
changes to take effect.

There are three configuration scopes:

- **local** - the option value is read from the `.watchmanconfig` file in the
  associated root.
- **global** - the option value is read from the `/etc/watchman.json` file
- **fallback** - the option value is read from the `.watchmanconfig` file. If
  the option was not present in the `.watchmanconfig` file, then read it from
  the `/etc/watchman.json` file.

This table shows the scoping and availability of the various options:

Specifies the settle period in _milliseconds_. This controls how long the
filesystem should be idle before dispatching triggers. The default value is 20
milliseconds.

_Since 3.1._

Specifies a list of files that, if present in a directory, identify that
directory as the root of a project.

If left unspecified, to aid in transitioning between versions, watchman will use
the value of the now deprecated [root\_restrict\_files](#root_restrict_files)
configuration setting.

If neither `root_files` nor `root_restrict_files` is specified in the
configuration, watchman will use a default value consisting of:

- `.git`
- `.hg`
- `.svn`
- `.watchmanconfig`

Watchman will add `.watchmanconfig` to whatever value is specified for this
configuration value if it is not present.

This example causes only `.watchmanconfig` to be considered as a project root
file:

    {  "root_files": [".watchmanconfig"]}

See the [watch-project](/watchman/docs/cmd/watch-project) command for more
information.

_Since 3.1._

This is a boolean option that defaults to `false`. If it is set to `true` then
the [watch](/watchman/docs/cmd/watch) command will only succeed if the requested
directory contains one of the files listed by the [root\_files](#root_files)
configuration option, and the [watch-project](/watchman/docs/cmd/watch-project)
command will only succeed if a valid project root is found.

If left unspecified, to aid in transitioning between versions, watchman will
check to see if the now deprecated [root\_restrict\_files](#root_restrict_files)
configuration setting is present. If it is found then the effective value of
`enforce_root_files` is set to `true`.

_Deprecated starting in version 3.1; use [root\_files](#root_files) and
[enforce\_root\_files](#enforce_root_files) to effect the same behavior._

Specifies a list of files, at least one of which should be present in a
directory for watchman to add it as a root. By default there are no
restrictions.

For example,

    {  "root_restrict_files": [".git", ".hg"]}

will allow watches only in the top level of Git or Mercurial repositories.

Specifies a list of filesystem types that watchman is prohibited to attempt to
watch. Watchman will determine the filesystem type of the root of a watch; if
the typename is present in the `illegal_fstypes` list, the watch will be
prohibited. You may also specify `illegal_fstypes_advice` as a string with
additional advice to your user. The purpose of this configuration option is
largely to prevent the use of Watchman on network mounted filesystems. On Linux
systems, Watchman may not be able to determine the precise type name of a
mounted filesystem. If the filesystem type is not known to watchman, it will be
reported as `unknown`.

For example,

    {  "illegal_fstypes": ["nfs", "cifs", "smb"],  "illegal_fstypes_advice": "use a local directory"}

will prevent watching dirs mounted on network filesystems and provide the advice
to use a local directory. You may omit the `illegal_fstypes_advice` setting to
use a default suggestion to relocate the directory to local disk.

Apply special VCS ignore logic to the set of named dirs. This option has a
default value of `[".git", ".hg", ".svn"]`. Dirs that match this option are
observed and watched using special shallow logic. The shallow watch allows
watchman to mildly abuse the version control directories to store its query
cookie files and to observe VCS locking activity without having to watch the
entire set of VCS data for large trees.

Dirs that match are completely ignored by watchman. This is useful to ignore a
directory that contains only build products and where file change notifications
are unwanted because of the sheer volume of files.

For example,

    {  "ignore_dirs": ["build"]}

would ignore the `build` directory at the top level of the watched tree, and
everything below it. It will never appear in the watchman query results for the
tree.

On Linux systems, `ignore_dirs` is respected at the OS level; the kernel simply
will not tell watchman about changes to ignored dirs. macOS and Windows have
limited or no support for this, so watchman needs to process and ignore this
class of change.

For large trees or especially busy build dirs, it is recommended that you move
the busy build dirs out of the tree for more optimal performance.

Since version 2.9.9, if you list a dir in `ignore_dirs` that is also listed in
`ignore_vcs`, the `ignore_dirs` placement will take precedence. This may not
sound like a big deal, but since `ignore_vcs` is used as a hint to for the
placement of [cookie files](/watchman/docs/cookies), having these two options
overlap in earlier versions would break watchman queries.

_Since 4.6._

On macOS the first 8 items listed in `ignore_dirs` can be accelerated at the OS
level. This means that changes to those paths are not even communicated to the
watchman service. Entries beyond the first 8 are processed and ignored by
watchman. If your workload is prone to recrawl events you will want to
prioritize your `ignore_dirs` list so that the most busy ignored locations
occupy the first 8 positions in this list.

Deleted files (and dirs) older than this are periodically pruned from the
internal view of the filesystem. Until they are pruned, they will be visible to
queries but will have their `exists` field set to `false`. Once they are pruned,
watchman will remember the most recent clock value of the pruned nodes. Any
since queries based on a clock prior to the last prune clock will be treated as
a fresh instance query. This allows a client to detect and choose how to handle
the case where they have missed changes. See `is_fresh_instance` elsewhere in
this document for more information. The default for this is `43200` (12 hours).

How often to check for, and prune out, deleted nodes per the `gc_age_seconds`
option description above. The default for this is `86400` (24 hours). Set this
to `0` to disable the periodic pruning operation.

Controls the latency parameter that is passed to `FSEventStreamCreate` on macOS.
The value is measured in seconds. The fixed value of this parameter prior to
version 3.2 of watchman was `0.0001` seconds. Starting in version 3.2 of
watchman, the default is now `0.01` seconds and can be controlled on a per-root
basis.

If you observe problems with `kFSEventStreamEventFlagUserDropped` increasing the
latency parameter will allow the system to batch more change notifications
together and operate more efficiently.

This is macOS specific.

_Since 4.6._

Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, if a watch receives a
`kFSEventStreamEventFlagUserDropped` event, attempt to resync from the
`fsevents` journal if it is available. The journal may not be available if one
or more volumes are mounted read-only, if the administrator has purged the
journal, or if the `fsevents` id numbers have rolled over.

This resync operation is advantageous because it effectively allows rewinding
and replaying the event stream from a known point in time and avoids the need to
recrawl the entire watch.

If this option is set to `false`, or if the journal is not available, the
original strategy of recrawling the watched directory tree is used instead.

_Since 4.7._

The default changed to `true`. In addition, this resync strategy is now also
applied to `kFSEventStreamEventFlagKernelDropped` events.

_Since December 2021._

The default changed to `false`. There are possible undiagnosed correctness
issues with this setting.

This is macOS specific.

Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, Watchman will use several FSEvents
streams to watch a directory hierarchy instead of a single stream. This has been
shown to significantly reduce the number of `kFSEventStreamEventFlagUserDropped`
events for workflows issuing heavy writes to a top-level directory that is
listed in [ignore\_dirs](#ignore_dirs).

_Since 3.7._

How many seconds a watch can remain idle before becoming a candidate for
reaping, measured in seconds. The default for this is `432000` (5 days). Set
this to `0` to prevent reaping.

A watch is considered to be idle when it has had no commands that operate on it
for `idle_reap_age_seconds`. If an idle watch has no triggers and no
subscriptions then it will be cancelled, releasing the associated operating
system resources, and removed from the state file.

_Since 3.9._

Used to pre-size hash tables used to track files per directory. This is most
impactful during the initial crawl of the filesystem. Setting this too small
will increase the chance of a hash insert having a collision and drive up the
cost of the insert and subsequent gets.

Prior to version 3.9 of watchman this value was fixed at `2`. Starting in
version 3.9 the default value is `64` and can be configured via this setting in
the `.watchmanconfig` or the global `/etc/watchman.json` configuration file.

Setting this value very large increases the memory overhead per directory in the
tree; the value is rounded up to the next power of two and pre-allocated in an
array of pointers. On a 64-bit system multiply that number by 8 to arrive at the
number of bytes of overhead (halve this on a 32-bit system). The overhead is
doubled when using a case insensitive filesystem.

The ideal size from a time complexity perspective is the number of files in your
largest directory. From a space complexity perspective, the ideal size is 1; you
would pay the cost of the collisions during the initial crawl and have a more
optimal memory usage. Since watchman is primarily employed as an accelerator,
we'd recommend biasing towards using more memory and taking less time to run.

_Since 4.6_

Used to pre-size hash tables that are used to track the total set of files in
the entire watched tree. The default value for this is 131072.

The optimal size is a power-of-two larger than the number of directories in your
tree; running `find . -type d | wc -l` will tell you the number that you have.

Making this number too large is potentially wasteful of memory. Making this
number too small results in increased latency during crawling while the hash
tables are rebuilt.

_Since 4.7_

When set to `true`, watchman will not produce recrawl related warning fields in
the response PDUs of various requests. The default is `false`; the intent is
that someone in your organization should be aware of recrawls and be able to
manage the configuration and workload. Some sites employ an alternative
mechanism for sampling and reporting this to the right set of people and wish to
disable the warning so that it doesn't appear in front of users that are unable
to make the appropriate configuration changes for themselves.

This is specific to the EdenFS watcher

When set to a non-zero value, Watchman will return a _fresh instance_ to since
queries/subscriptions if the number of changed files exceeds the configured
value. In particular, during large updates of the working copies, a lot of files
may have changed forcing both Watchman and EdenFS to fetch a significant amount
of metadata to answer these queries.

This behavior is only enabled if the query specifies the
`empty_on_fresh_instance` option or when this config is set to `0`. Default to
`10000`.

Compatibility Rules | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

has been used in production since a few weeks after it was first written, and
thus it has always made an effort to be backward compatible across releases and
platforms.

- Commands and options will never be removed, but new ones may be added.
- We may _deprecate_ commands and options and remove them from documentation,
  but they will still continue to work forever.
- Whenever a command or option is deprecated, we will provide a suitable
  alternative.
- Bugfixes might cause minor behavior changes -- these changes will usually be
  documented in release notes.

`watchman` does **not** follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org)!

- Since its public APIs never make incompatible changes, MAJOR versions are
  moot.
- While in the past we've released versions with three components (x.y.z),
  starting version 3.1 the version number will only have two components that are
  meaningful (x.y), with the third component always zero.
- The version after 3.9 is expected to be 4.0. The version number string
  reported by these versions will be 3.9.0 and 4.0.0 respectively.

_Since 3.8._

`watchman` introduces [capabilities](/watchman/docs/capabilities) to describe
new or optional features. You can use the
[expanded version command](/watchman/docs/cmd/version) to query capabilities and
avoid building knowledge of version numbers in your client application(s).

_Since May 2020_

Watchman is continuously deployed inside Facebook, which means that we don't
explicitly maintain version numbers. For a while we maintained version numbers
for GitHub releases but found it to be too much overhead.

Starting in 2020 we've set up automation to cut a weekly date based on the date;
this more closely matches our internal processes than manually managing version
numbers.

You'll notice that both the
[tags on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/tags) and the version
reported by `watchman version` are date based.

watch-project | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 3.1._

Requests that the _project_ containing the requested dir is watched for changes.
Watchman will track all files and dirs rooted at the _project_ path, and respond
with the relative path difference between the _project_ path and the requested
dir.

With a proliferation of tools that wish to take advantage of filesystem watching
at different locations in a filesystem tree, it is possible and likely for those
tools to establish multiple overlapping watches.

Most systems have a finite limit on the number of directories that can be
watched effectively; when that limit is exceeded the performance and reliability
of filesystem watching is degraded, sometimes to the point that it ceases to
function.

It is therefore desirable to avoid this situation and consolidate the filesystem
watches. Watchman offers the `watch-project` command to allow clients to opt-in
to the watch consolidation behavior described below.

A project is the logical root of a set of related files in a filesystem tree and
is a good point at which to consolidate watches. Tools such as
[hgwatchman](https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hgwatchman) will most likely have
already established a watch at the root of a project, so any other tools that
wish to watch a sub-directory can do so for no additional cost if they re-use
that existing watch at a higher level in the filesystem tree.

The `watch-project` command uses a simple procedure to locate the _project_ path
that corresponds to a given path. While simple it is rather verbose to describe
it precisely:

1. The search is begun with a list of file names; we'll refer to it as
   `root_files`. Any file in this list, if present in a directory, identifies
   that directory as being a valid project directory.
2. The search is begun with the candidate directory set to the argument passed
   to `watch-project`. The candidate directory is passed to the `realpath(3)`
   function and the result is set as the new value of the candidate directory.
3. The candidate directory is concatenated with each of the `root_files`, one by
   one, and the resultant path is tested for existence. If the path exists then
   the candidate directory is the path that will be used for watch and the
   search is halted successfully.
4. If none of the `root_files` can be found in the candidate directory then the
   parent of the candidate directory is used as a new candidate and the process
   is repeated at step 3 above.
5. If no viable candidates are found and the root of the filesystem is reached,
   then the search terminates unsuccessfully.

Watchman may perform the above search procedure twice. The logic is:

1. `root_files` will be set to list only `.watchmanconfig`
2. Perform the search procedure above
3. If the search terminates successfully, then the watch is established for the
   current value of the candidate directory.
4. If the search terminates unsuccessfully, `root_files` is set to the global
   configuration option [root\_files](/watchman/docs/config#root_files) and the
   search procedure is re-run.
5. If the search terminates successfully, then the watch is established for the
   current value of the candidate directory.
6. If the global configuration option
   [enforce\_root\_files](/watchman/docs/config#enforce_root_files) is set to
   true then the watch attempt fails.
7. Otherwise, the watch is established for the original argument to the
   `watch-project` command

What this means in laymans terms is that the definitive location of the project
root is where the `.watchmanconfig` file is found. If it is not found then the
set of files defined by the `root_files` configuration is used to locate a
candidate.

If no viable candidate is found then watchman will watch the requested
directory, unless the `enforce_root_files` setting is set to true.

The default value for `root_files` will match most common version control root
directories. The default value for `enforce_root_files` is `false`.

Assuming that `~/www/.hg` and `~/www/some/child/dir` both exist, then the
command:

    $ watchman watch-project ~/www/some/child/dir{  "version": "3.0.1",  "watch": "/Users/wez/www",  "relative_path": "some/child/dir"}

establishes a watch on the `~/www` directory because that is the directory that
contains `.hg`, which is one of the items listed in the default value for
`root_files`.

As a client using `watch-project` it is important to observe the `relative_path`
and/or `watch` elements of the response; they identify which directory is
actually being watched. **Any triggers, subscriptions or queries that the client
issues must be relative to the watched root to operate as expected.** A client
can use `relative_path` to more easily construct queries or adjust the results
of queries by either concatenating the string when composing paths in a query
expression or removing the string from the prefix when processing the results.

If `relative_path` is missing from the response it means that the requested dir
is the same as the watched dir and that the `watch-project` invocation turned
out to be exactly equivalent to a `watch` invocation for the requested
directory.

Note that, when you're using the CLI, you can specify the root as
`~/www/some/child/dir` because the shell will resolve `~/www/some/child/dir` to
`/Users/wez/www/some/child/dir`, but when you use the JSON protocol, you are
responsible for supplying an absolute path.

JSON:

    ["watch", "/Users/wez/www/some/child/dir"]

Once a viable candidate is found, if watchman is not already watching the
directory, then watchman will:

- Establish change notification for the directory with the kernel
- Queues up a request to crawl the directory
- As the directory contents are resolved, those are watched in a similar fashion
- All newly observed files are considered changed

Unless the `--no-save-state` server option was used to start the watchman
service, watches and their associated triggers are saved and re-established
across a process restart.

_Since 3.7._

The watchman service may decide to reap watches that have been idle for an
extended period of time. A watch is considered to be idle if no watchman queries
have been issued against the watch. If a watch is idle, and has no triggers
registered or active subscriptions then it is a candidate for reaping.

The [idle\_reap\_age\_seconds](/watchman/docs/config#idle-reap-age-seconds)
configuration parameter controls the idle timeout for a watch. The default is 5
days. A reaped watch is cancelled and removed from the state file.

watch | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Deprecated starting in version 3.1. We recommend that clients adopt the
[watch-project](/watchman/docs/cmd/watch-project) command.

Requests that the specified dir is watched for changes. Watchman will track all
files and dirs rooted at the specified path.

From the command line:

    $ watchman watch ~/www

Note that, when you're using the CLI, you can specify the root as `~/www`
because the shell will resolve `~/www` to `/home/wez/www`, but when you use the
JSON protocol, you are responsible for supplying an absolute path.

JSON:

    ["watch", "/home/wez/www"]

Watchman will `realpath(3)` the directory and start watching it if it isn't
already. A newly watched directory is processed in a couple of stages:

- Establishes change notification for the directory with the kernel
- Queues up a request to crawl the directory
- As the directory contents are resolved, those are watched in a similar fashion
- All newly observed files are considered changed

Unless the `--no-save-state` server option was used to start the watchman
service, watches and their associated triggers are saved and re-established
across a process restart.

Watchman has the following level of support for case-insensitive filesystems,
starting in version 2.9.9 on macOS only:

- each watched root is queried to determine if it is case-insensitive. This is
  the common default for most Mac systems running HFS+.
- When in case-insensitive mode, Watchman will attempt to resolve the true
  canonical name of a file on the filesystem when it observes changes.
- If the case of a filename changes, Watchman will report a delete of the old
  name and a change for the new name.
- Query expressions that match names will default to case-insensitive when the
  root is on a case-insensitive filesystem.
- Watchman's case folding is ASCII case-folding. Note that the `match` and
  `pcre` query expression terms request case folding support from the containing
  library, and that their case folding behavior is not controlled by Watchman
  beyond being enabled when the root is case-insensitive.
- The `path` generator is always case sensitive.

version | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The version command will tell you the version and build information for the
currently running watchman service:

    $ watchman version{    "version": "2.9.6",    "buildinfo": "git:2727d9a1e47a4a2229c65cbb2f0c7656cbd96270"}

To get the version of the client:

    $ watchman -v2.9.8

If the server and client versions don't match up, you should probably restart
your server: `watchman shutdown-server ; watchman`.

_Since 3.8._

The version command can be used to check for named capabilities. Capabilities
make it easier to check whether the server implements functionality based on the
name of that function rather than by having the client build up knowledge about
when those functions were introduced.

You can read more about the
[available capability names](/watchman/docs/capabilities).

To check whether the `relative_root` capability is supported:

    $ watchman -j <<< '["version", {"optional":["relative_root"]}]'{    "version": "3.8.0",    "capabilities": {        "relative_root": true    }}

If the capability is not supported:

    $ watchman -j <<< '["version", {"optional":["will-never-exist"]}]'{    "version": "3.8.0",    "capabilities": {        "will-never-exist": false    }}

To have the server generate an error response if a capability is not supported:

    $ watchman -j <<< '["version", {"required":["will-never-exist"]}]'{    "version": "3.8.0",    "capabilities": {        "will-never-exist": false    },    "error": "client required capability `will-never-exist` is not supported by this server"}

To require one feature and test whether some optional features are supported:

    $ watchman -j <<< '["version", {"required":["term-match"],"optional":["a","b"]}]'{    "version": "3.8.0",    "capabilities": {        "a": false,        "b": false,        "term-match": true    }}

The **node** and **python** clients provide a `capabilityCheck` method that will
perform the version check above, and that also provide limited support for
testing capability support against older versions of the watchman server. This
facilitates a smoother transition from version number based checks to capability
named based checks.

In _python_:

    import pywatchmanclient = pywatchman.client()# will throw an error if any of the required names are not supportedres = client.capabilityCheck(optional=['a'], required=['term-match'])print res# {'version': '3.8.0', 'capabilities': {'term-match': True, 'a': False}}

In _node_:

    var watchman = require('fb-watchman');var client = new watchman.Client();client.capabilityCheck({optional:['a'], required:['term-match']},    function (error, resp) {        if (error) {          // error will be an Error object if any of the required named          // are not supported        }        console.log(resp);        // {'version': '3.8.0', 'capabilities': {'term-match': false, 'a': false}}        client.end();    });

trigger | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The trigger command will create or replace a trigger.

A trigger is a saved incremental query over a watched root. When files change
that match the query expression, Watchman will spawn a process and pass
information about the changed files to it.

Triggered processes are spawned by the Watchman server process that runs in the
background; they do not have access to your terminal and their output is
redirected (by default) to the Watchman log file.

Watchman waits for the filesystem to settle before processing any triggers,
batching the list of changed files together before invoking the registered
command. You can adjust the settle period via the `.watchmanconfig` file.

Note that deleted files are counted as changed files and are passed the command
in exactly the same way as changed-but-existing files.

Watchman will only run a single instance of the trigger process at a time. That
avoids fork-bomb style behavior in cases where your trigger also modifies files.
When the process terminates, watchman will re-evaluate the trigger criteria
based on the clock at the time the process was last spawned; if a file list is
generated watchman will spawn a new child with the files that changed in the
meantime.

Unless `no-save-state` is in use, triggers are saved and re-established across a
Watchman process restart. If you had triggeres saved prior to upgrading to
Watchman 2.9.7, those triggers will be forgotten as you upgrade past version
2.9.7; you will need to re-register them.

There are two syntaxes for registering triggers; a simple syntax that allows
very simple trigger configuration with some reasonable defaults, and a second
extended syntax which is available since Watchman version 2.9.7.

The simple syntax is implemented in terms of the extended syntax and is
preserved for backwards compatibility with older clients.

_Since 2.9.7._

You may use the extended JSON trigger definition syntax detailed below. It
provides more control over how the triggered commands are invoked than was
possible in earlier versions.

JSON:

    ["trigger", "/path/to/dir", <triggerobj>]

Where `triggerobj` is a trigger configuration object with the fields defined
below.

Here's an example trigger specified via the CLI that will cause `make` to be run
whenever assets or sources are changed:

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["trigger", "/path/to/root", {  "name": "assets",  "expression": ["pcre", "\.(js|css|c|cpp)$"],  "command": ["make"]}]EOT

The possible trigger object properties are:

- `name` defines the name of the trigger. You may use this name to remove the
  trigger later. Registering a different trigger with the same name as an
  existing trigger will implicitly delete the old trigger and then register the
  new one, causing the trigger expression to be evaluated for the whole tree.

- `command` specifies the command to invoke. It must be an array of string
  values; this will form the argv array of the trigger process. When the trigger
  is spawned, the `$PATH` of the Watchman process will be used to locate the
  command. If you have changed your `$PATH` since the Watchman process was
  started, Watchman won't be able to see your new `$PATH`. If you are
  registering trigger that runs something from an unusual or non-default
  location, it is recommended that you specify the full path to that command. If
  you are registering a trigger script that can be found in the watched root,
  just specify the path relative to the root.

- `append_files` is an optional boolean parameter; if enabled, the `command`
  array will have the set of matching file names appended when the trigger is
  invoked. System limits such as `sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)` and/or `RLIMIT_STACK`
  set an upper bound on the size of the parameters and environment that are
  passed to a spawned process. Watchman will try to ensure that the command is
  runnable by keeping the number of file name arguments below the system limits.
  If the full set cannot be passed to the process, Watchman will pass as many as
  it thinks will fit and omit the rest. When this argument list truncation
  occurs, Watchman will export `WATCHMAN_FILES_OVERFLOW=true` into the
  environment so that the child process can determine that this has happened.
  Watchman cannot break the arguments apart and run multiple processes for each
  argument batch; for that functionality, use `xargs(1)` for the `command` and
  set the `stdin` property to `NAME_PER_LINE`.

- `expression` accepts a query expression. The expression is applied to the list
  of changed files to generate the set of files that are relevant to this
  trigger. If no files match, the command will not be invoked. Omitting the
  expression will match all changed files.

- `stdin` specifies how stdin should be configured for the command invocation.
  You may set the value of this property to one of the following:

  - the string value `/dev/null` - sets stdin to read from `/dev/null`. This is
    the default and will be used if you omit the `stdin` property.

  - an array value will be interpreted as a list of field names. When the
    command is invoked, Watchman will generate an array of JSON objects that
    contain those field names on stdin. For example, if `stdin` is set to
    `["name", "size"]`, stdin will be a JSON array containing the list of
    changed files, represented as objects with the `name` and `size` properties:
    `[{"name": "filename.txt", "size": 123}]`. The list of valid fields is the
    same as the same as that documented in the `query` command. Just as with the
    `query` command, if the field list is comprised of a single field then the
    JSON will be an array of those field values. For instance, if you set
    `stdin` to `["name"]` the JSON will be of the form `["filename.txt"]`
    instead of `[{"name": "filename.txt"}]`.

  - the string value `NAME_PER_LINE` will cause Watchman to generate a list of
    file names on stdin, one name per line. No quoting will be applied to the
    names, and they may contain spaces.

- `stdout` and `stderr` control the output and error streams. If omitted, the
  corresponding stream will be inherited from the Watchman process, which
  typically means that the command output/error stream will show up in the
  Watchman log file. If specified, the value must be a string:

  - `>path/to/file` - causes output to redirected to the specified file. The
    path is relative to the watched root, and will be truncated prior to being
    written to, if it exists, or created if it does not exist.

  - `>>path/to/file` - causes output to redirected to the specified file. The
    path is relative to the watched root. If the file already exists then it
    will be appended to. The file will be created if it does not exist.

- `max_files_stdin` specifies a limit on the number of files reported on stdin
  when stdin is set to hold the set of matched files. If the number of files
  that matched exceeds this limit, the input will be truncated to match this
  limit and `WATCHMAN_FILES_OVERFLOW=true` will also be exported into the
  environment. The default, if omitted, is no limit.

- `chdir` can be used to specify the working directory that should be set prior
  to spawning the process. The default is to set the working directory to the
  watched root. The value of this property is a string that will be interpreted
  relative to the watched root. Note that changing the working dir does not
  cause the file names from the query result to be re-written: they will
  _always_ be relative to the watched root. The path to the root can be found in
  the `$WATCHMAN_ROOT` environmental variable.

The simple syntax is easier to execute from the CLI than the JSON based extended
syntax, but doesn't allow all of the trigger options to be set. In only supports
the [Simple Pattern Syntax](/watchman/docs/simple-query) for queries.

From the command line:

    $ watchman -- trigger /path/to/dir triggername [patterns] -- [cmd]

Note that the first `--` is to distinguish watchman CLI switches from the second
`--`, which delimits patterns from the trigger command. This is only needed when
using the CLI, not when using the JSON protocol.

JSON:

    ["trigger", "/path/to/dir", "triggername", <patterns>, "--", <cmd>]

For example:

    $ watchman -- trigger ~/www jsfiles '*.js' -- ls -l

Note the single quotes around the `*.js`; if you omit them, your shell will
expand it to a list of file names and register those in the trigger. While this
would work, any `*.js` files that you add after registering the trigger will not
cause the trigger to run.

or in JSON:

    ["trigger", "/home/wez/www", "jsfiles", "*.js", "--", "ls", "-l"]

The simple syntax is interpreted as a trigger object with the following
settings:

- `name` is set to the `triggername`
- `command` is set to the `<cmd>` list
- `expression` is generated from the `<patterns>` list using the rules laid out
  in [Simple Pattern Syntax](/watchman/docs/simple-query)
- `append_files` is set to `true`
- `stdin` is set to `["name", "exists", "new", "size", "mode"]`
- `stdout` and `stderr` will be set to output to the Watchman log file
- `max_files_stdin` will be left unset

For this simple example, if `~/www/scripts/foo.js` is changed, watchman will
chdir to `~/www` then invoke `ls -l scripts/foo.js`. Note that the output will
show up in the Watchman log file, not in your terminal.

Since Watchman version 2.9.7, the following environment variables are set for
all trigger commands, even those registered using the simple trigger syntax:

- `WATCHMAN_FILES_OVERFLOW` is set to `true` if the number of files exceeds
  either the `max_files_stdin` limit or the system argument size limit.
- `WATCHMAN_CLOCK` is set to the current clock at the time of the trigger
  invocation
- `WATCHMAN_SINCE` is set to the clock value of the prior trigger invocation, or
  unset if this is the first trigger invocation.
- `WATCHMAN_ROOT` is set to the path to the watched root
- `WATCHMAN_TRIGGER` is set to the name of the trigger
- `WATCHMAN_SOCK` is set to the path to the Watchman socket, so that you can
  figure out how to connect back to Watchman.

_Since 3.4._

Watchman supports optionally evaluating triggers with respect to a path within a
watched root. This is used with the `relative_root` parameter:

    ["trigger", "/path/to/watched/root", {  "name": "relative-assets",  "expression": ["pcre", "\.(js|css|c|cpp)$"],  "command": ["make"],  "relative_root": "project1"}]

Setting a relative root results in the following modifications to triggers:

- Queries are evaluated with respect to the relative root. See
  [File Queries](/watchman/docs/file-query) for more.
- The current directory for triggered processes is set to the relative root,
  unless it is changed with `chdir`. If `chdir` is a relative path then it will
  be evaluated with respect to the relative root. So, for the example trigger
  above, if `chdir` is `"subdir2"`, the current directory for triggered `make`
  invocations is `/path/to/watched/root/project1/subdir2`.
- In the environment, `WATCHMAN_ROOT` is still set to the actual root.
- `WATCHMAN_RELATIVE_ROOT` is set to the full path of the relative root.

Relative roots behave similarly to a separate Watchman watch on the
subdirectory, without any of the system overhead that that imposes. This is
useful for large repositories, where your script or tool is only interested in a
particular directory inside the repository.

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/cmd/subscribe

subscribe | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 1.6_

Subscribes to changes against a specified root and requests that they be sent to
the client via its connection. The updates will continue to be sent while the
connection is open. If the connection is closed, the subscription is implicitly
removed.

This makes the most sense in an application connecting via the socket interface,
but you may also subscribe via the command line tool if you're interested in
observing the changes for yourself:

    $ watchman -j --server-encoding=json -p <<-EOT["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "mysubscriptionname", {  "expression": ["allof",    ["type", "f"],    ["not", "empty"],    ["suffix", "php"]  ],  "fields": ["name"]}]EOT

The example above registers a subscription against the specified root with the
name `mysubscriptionname`.

The response to a subscribe command looks like this:

    {  "version":   "1.6",  "subscribe": "mysubscriptionname"}

When the subscription is first established, the expression term is evaluated and
if any files match, a subscription notification packet is generated and sent,
unilaterally to the client.

Then, each time a change is observed, and after the settle period has passed,
the expression is evaluated again. If any files are matched, the server will
unilaterally send the query results to the client with a packet that looks like
this:

    {  "version": "1.6",  "clock": "c:1234:123",  "files": ["one.php"],  "root":  "/path/being/watched",  "subscription": "mysubscriptionname"}

The subscribe command object allows the client to specify a since parameter; if
present in the command, the initial set of subscription results will only
include files that changed since the specified clockspec, equivalent to using
the `query` command with the `since` generator.

    ["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "myname", {  "since": "c:1234:123",  "expression": ["not", "empty"],  "fields": ["name"]}]

The suggested mode of operation is for the client process to maintain its own
local copy of the last "clock" value and use that to establish the subscription
when it first connects.

Prior to watchman version 3.2, the settling behavior was to hold subscription
notifications until the kernel notification stream was complete.

Starting in watchman version 3.2, after the notification stream is complete, if
the root appears to be a version control directory, subscription notifications
will be held until an outstanding version control operation is complete (at the
time of writing, this is based on the presence of either `.hg/wlock` or
`.git/index.lock`). This behavior matches triggers and helps to avoid performing
transient work in response to files changing, for example, during a rebase
operation.

In some circumstances it is desirable for a client to observe the creation of
the control files at the start of a version control operation. You may specify
that you want this behavior by passing the `defer_vcs` flag to your subscription
command invocation:

    $ watchman -j -p <<-EOT["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "mysubscriptionname", {  "expression": ["allof",    ["type", "f"],    ["not", "empty"],    ["suffix", "php"]  ],  "defer_vcs": false,  "fields": ["name"]}]EOT

_Since 4.4_

In more complex integrations it is desirable to be able to have a watchman aware
application signal the beginning and end of some work that will generate a lot
of change notifications. For example, Mercurial or Git could communicate with
watchman before and after updating the working copy.

Some applications will want to know that the update is in progress and continue
to process notifications. Others may want to defer processing the notifications
until the update completes, and some may wish to drop any notifications produced
while the update was in progress.

Watchman subscriptions provide the mechanism for each of these use cases and
expose it via two new fields in the subscription object; `defer` and `drop` are
described below.

It can be difficult to mix `defer` and `drop` with multiple overlapping states
in the context of a given subscription stream as there is a single cursor to
track the subscription position.

If your application uses multiple overlapping states and wants to `defer` some
results and `drop` others, it is recommended that you use `drop` for all of the
states and then issues queries with `since` terms bounded by the `clock` fields
from the subscription state PDUs to ensure that it observes all of the results
of interest.

    ["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "mysubscriptionname", {  "defer": ["mystatename"],  "fields": ["name"]}]

The `defer` field specifies a list of state names for which the subscriber
wishes to defer the notification stream. When a watchman client signals that a
state has been entered via the [state-enter](/watchman/docs/cmd/state-enter)
command, if the state name matches any in the `defer` list then the subscription
will emit a unilateral subscription PDU like this:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-enter":   "mystatename",  "clock":         "<clock>",  "metadata":      <metadata from the state-enter command>}

Watchman will then defer sending any subscription PDUs with `files` payloads
until the state is vacated either by a
[state-leave](/watchman/docs/cmd/state-leave) command or by the client that
entered the state disconnecting from the watchman service.

Once the state is vacated, watchman will emit a unilateral subscription PDU like
this:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-leave":   "mystatename",  "clock":         "<clock>",  "metadata":      <metadata from the exit-state command>}

The subscription stream will then be re-enabled and notifications received since
the corresponding `state-enter` will be delivered to clients.

    ["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "mysubscriptionname", {  "drop": ["mystatename"],  "fields": ["name"]}]

The `drop` field specifies a list of state names for which the subscriber wishes
to discard the notification stream. It works very much like `defer` as described
above, but when a state is vacated, the pending notification stream is
fast-forwarded to the clock of the `state-leave` command, effectively
suppressing any notifications that were generated between the `state-enter` and
the `state-leave` commands.

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/cmd/state-leave

state-leave | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 4.4_

The `state-leave` command works in conjunction with
[state-enter](/watchman/docs/cmd/state-enter) to facilitate
[advanced settling in subscriptions](/watchman/docs/cmd/subscribe#advanced-settling).

`state-leave` causes a watch to no longer be marked as being in a particular
named state.

This is the simplest example, vacating a state named `mystate`:

    ["state-leave", "/path/to/root", "mystate"]

It will cause any subscribers to receive a unilateral subscription PDU from the
watchman server:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-leave":   "mystate",  "clock":         "c:1446410081:18462:7:135"}

The `clock` field in the response is the (synchronized; see below) clock at the
time that the state was entered and can be used in subsequent queries, in
combination with the corresponding `state-enter` subscription PDU clock, to
locate things that changed while the state was asserted.

A more complex example demonstrates passing metadata to any subscribers. The
`metadata` field is propagated through to the subscribers and is not interpreted
by the watchman server. It can be any JSON value.

    ["state-leave", "/path/to/root", {  "name": "mystate",  "metadata": {    "foo": "bar"  }}]

This will emit the following unilateral subscription PDU to all subscribers:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-leave":   "mystate",  "clock":         "c:1446410081:18462:7:137",  "metadata": {    "foo": "bar"  }}

A state is implicitly vacated when the watchman client session that asserted it
disconnects. This helps to avoid breaking subscribers (since the typical action
is to defer or drop notifications) if the tooling that initiated the state
terminates unexpectedly.

An abandoned state is reported to any subscribers via a unilateral subscription
PDU with the `abandoned` field set to `true`:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-leave":   "mystate",  "clock":         "c:1446410081:18462:7:137",  "abandoned":     true}

This allows the subscriber to take an appropriate action.

States are synchronized with the state of the filesystem so that it is possible
for subscribers to reason about when files changed with respect to the state.

This means that issuing a `state-leave` command will
[perform query synchronization](/watchman/docs/cookies#how-cookies-work) to
ensure that things are in sync.

The `state-leave` command will use a default `sync_timeout` of 60 seconds. If
the synchronization cookie is not observed within the configured `sync_timeout`,
an error will be returned and _the state will not be entered_.

In some cases, perhaps during the initial crawl of a very large tree, You may
specify an alternative value for the timeout; the value is expressed in
_milliseconds_:

    ["state-leave", "/path/to/root", {  "name": "mystate",  "sync_timeout": 10000,  "metadata": {    "foo": "bar"  }}]

You may also specify `0` for the timeout to disable synchronization for this
particular command. This may cause the state to appear to clients to have been
vacated logically before it actually did in the case that there are buffered
notifications that have not yet been processed by watchman at the time that the
state was vacated.

state-enter | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 4.4_

The `state-enter` command works in conjunction with
[state-leave](/watchman/docs/cmd/state-leave) to facilitate
[advanced settling in subscriptions](/watchman/docs/cmd/subscribe#advanced-settling).

`state-enter` causes a watch to be marked as being in a particular named state.
The state is asserted until a corresponding `state-leave` command is issued or
_until the watchman client session that entered the state disconnects_. This
automatic cleanup helps to avoid breaking subscribers if the tooling that
initiated a state terminates unexpectedly.

Subscriptions can use the [defer](/watchman/docs/cmd/subscribe#defer) and
[drop](/watchman/docs/cmd/subscribe#drop) fields to defer or drop notifications
generated while the watch is in a particular named state.

This is the simplest example; entering a state named `mystate`:

    ["state-enter", "/path/to/root", "mystate"]

It will cause any subscribers to receive a unilateral subscription PDU from the
watchman server:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-enter":   "mystate",  "clock":         "c:1446410081:18462:7:127"}

The `clock` field in the response is the (synchronized; see below) clock at the
time that the state was entered and can be used in subsequent queries, in
combination with the corresponding `state-leave` subscription PDU clock, to
locate things that changed while the state was asserted.

A more complex example demonstrates passing metadata to any subscribers. The
`metadata` field is propagated through to the subscribers and is not interpreted
by the watchman server. It can be any JSON value.

    ["state-enter", "/path/to/root", {  "name": "mystate",  "metadata": {    "foo": "bar"  }}]

This will emit the following unilateral subscription PDU to all subscribers:

    {  "subscription":  "mysubscriptionname",  "root":          "/path/to/root",  "state-enter":   "mystate",  "clock":         "c:1446410081:18462:7:137",  "metadata": {    "foo": "bar"  }}

States are synchronized with the state of the filesystem so that it is possible

<clockspec\> \[patterns\]

Finds all files that were modified since the specified clockspec that match the
optional list of patterns. If no patterns are specified, all modified files are
returned.

The response includes a `files` array, each element of which is an object with
fields containing information about the file:

    {    "version": "2.7",    "is_fresh_instance": true,    "clock": "c:80616:59",    "files": [        {            "cclock": "c:80616:1",            "ctime": 1357617635,            "dev": 16777220,            "exists": true,            "gid": 100,            "ino": 20161390,            "mode": 33188,            "mtime": 1357617635,            "name": "argv.c",            "nlink": 1,            "oclock": "c:80616:39",            "size": 1340,            "uid": 100        }    ]}

The fields should be largely self-explanatory; they correspond to fields from
the underlying `struct stat`, but a couple need special mention:

- **cclock** - The "created" clock; the clock value representing the time that
  this file was first observed, or the clock value where this file changed from
  deleted to non-deleted state.
- **oclock** - The "observed" clock; the clock value representing the time that
  this file was last observed to have changed.
- **exists** - whether we believe that the file exists on disk or not. If this
  is false, most of the other fields will be omitted.
- **new** - this is only set in cases where the file results were generated as
  part of a time or clock based query, such as the `since` command. If the
  `cclock` value for the file is newer than the time you specified then the file
  entry is marked as `new`. This allows you to more easily determine if the file
  was newly created without having to maintain a lot of state.

Executes a query against the specified root. This example uses the `-j` flag to
the watchman binary that tells it to read stdin and interpret it as the JSON
request object to send to the watchman service. This flag allows you to send in
a pretty JSON object (as shown above), but if you're using the socket interface
you must still format the object as a single line JSON request as documented in
the protocol spec.

The first argument to query is the path to the watched root. The second argument
holds a JSON object describing the query to be run. The query object is
processed by passing it to the query engine (see
[File Queries](/watchman/docs/file-query)) which will generate a set of matching
files.

The query command will then consult the `fields` member of the query object; if
it is not present it will default to:

    "fields": ["name", "exists", "new", "size", "mode"]

For each file in the result set, the query command will generate a JSON object
value populated with the requested fields. For example, the default set of
fields will return a response something like this:

    {    "version": "2.9",    "clock": "c:80616:59",    "is_fresh_instance": false,    "files": [        {            "exists": true,            "mode": 33188,            "new": false,            "name": "argv.c",            "size": 1340,        }    ]}

If a field's value cannot be computed, a field's value may be `null`, or may be
an object with an `error` key containing a descriptive message string:

    {    "version": "2019-07-22T13:50:36Z",    "is_fresh_instance": false,    "clock": "c:1563834049:1830370:791543813:2257494",    "files": [        {            "content.sha1hex": null,            "name": "docs"            "symlink_target": null,            "type": "d",        },        {            "content.sha1hex": {                "error": "eloop: file is a symlink: Invalid argument: Invalid argument"            },            "type": "l",            "symlink_target": "eloop",            "name": "eloop"        }    ]}

For queries using the `since` generator, the `is_fresh_instance` member is true
if the particular clock value indicates that it was returned by a different
instance of watchman, or a named cursor hasn't been seen before. In that case,
only files that currently exist will be returned, and all files will have `new`
set to `true`. For all other queries, is\_fresh\_instance will always be true.
Advanced users may set the input parameter `empty_on_fresh_instance` to true, in
which case no files will be returned for fresh instances.

If the `fields` member consists of a single entry, the files result will be a
simple array of values; ~~"fields": \["name"\]~~ produces:

    {    "version": "1.5",    "clock": "c:80616:59",    "files": ["argv.c", "foo.c"]}

- `name` - string: the filename, relative to the watched root
- `exists` - bool: true if the file exists, false if it has been deleted
- `cclock` - string: the "created clock"; the clock value when we first observed
  the file, or the clock value when it last switched from !exists to exists.
- `oclock` - string: the "observed clock"; the clock value where we last
  observed some change in this file or its metadata.
- `ctime`, `ctime_ms`, `ctime_us`, `ctime_ns`, `ctime_f` - last inode change
  time measured in integer seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds or
  floating point seconds respectively.
- `mtime`, `mtime_ms`, `mtime_us`, `mtime_ns`, `mtime_f` - modified time
  measured in integer seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds or
  floating point seconds respectively.
- `size` - integer: file size in bytes
- `mode` - integer: file (or directory) mode expressed as a decimal integer
- `uid` - integer: the owning uid
- `gid` - integer: the owning gid
- `ino` - integer: the inode number
- `dev` - integer: the device number
- `nlink` - integer: number of hard links
- `new` - bool: whether this entry is newer than the `since` generator criteria

_Since 3.1._

- `type` - string: the file type. Has the the values listed in
  [the type query expression](/watchman/docs/expr/type)

_Since 4.6._

- `symlink_target` - string: the target of a symbolic link if the file is a
  symbolic link

_Since 4.9._

- `content.sha1hex` - string: the SHA-1 digest of the file's byte content,
  encoded as 40 hexidecimal digits (e.g.
  `"da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"` for an empty file)

By default a `query` will wait for up to 60 seconds for the view of the
filesystem to become current. Watchman decides that the view is current by
creating a cookie file and waiting to observe the notification that it is
present. If the cookie is not observed within the sync\_timeout period then the
query invocation will error out with a synchronization error message.

If your synchronization requirements differ from the default, you may pass in
your desired timeout when you construct your query; it must be an integer value
expressed in milliseconds:

    ["query", "/path/to/root", {  "expression": ["exists"],  "fields": ["name"],  "sync_timeout": 60000}]

You may specify `0` as the value if you do not wish for the query to create a
cookie and synchronize; the query will be evaluated over the present view of the
tree, which may lag behind the present state of the filesystem.

_Since 4.6._

By default queries will wait for up to 60 seconds to acquire a lock to inspect
the view of the filesystem tree. In practice, this timeout should never be hit
(it is indicative of an environmental or load related issue). However, in some
situations it is important to ensure that the query attempt times out sooner
than this. You may use the `lock_timeout` field to control this behavior.
`lock_timeout` must be an integer value expressed in milliseconds:

    ["query", "/path/to/root", {  "expression": ["exists"],  "fields": ["name"],  "lock_timeout": 60000,  "sync_timeout": 60000}]

Prior to version 4.6, the `lock_timeout` could not be configured and had an
effective value of infinity.

_Since 2.9.9._

On systems where the watched root is a case insensitive filesystem (this is the
common case for macOS and Windows), various name matching operations default to
case insensitive.

_Since 4.7._

You may override the case sensitivity of the various name matching operations by
setting the `case_sensitive` field in your query spec. It default to the case
sensitivity of the watched root. This is useful in cases where you know that the
contents of the tree are treated case sensitively by your various tools but are
running on a case insensitive filesystem. By forcing the name matches to case
sensitive mode the matches are faster and in some cases can be accelerated by
using alternative algorithms.

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["query", "/path/to/root", {  "suffix": "php",  "expression": ["match", "foo*.c", "basename"],  "case_sensitive": true,  "fields": ["name"]}]EOT

Generally, Watchman should report changes to directories for all queries.

On EdenFS repositories there is an exception. When the user has changed commits
in the duration of a time query, directory changes may not be reported across
those commit changes.

the option `always_include_directories` exists to include events for directories
across commit transitions. This is only supported for mercurial. This can be
expensive, so clients who do not need this are recommended not to use this. This
value defaults to false.

log-level | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

From the command line:

    $ watchman --server-encoding=json --persistent log-level debug

JSON:

    ["log-level", "debug"]

This command changes the log level of your client session. Whenever watchman
writes to its log, it walks the list of client sessions and also sends a log
packet to any that have their log level set to match the current log event.

Valid log levels are:

- `debug` - receive all log events
- `error` - receive only important log events
- `off` - receive no log events

Note that you cannot tap into the output of triggered processes using this
mechanism.

Log events are sent unilaterally by the server as they happen, and have the
following structure:

    {  "version": "1.0",  "log": "log this please"}

This command returns the full list of supported
[capabilities](/watchman/docs/capabilities) offered by the watchman server. The
intention is that client applications will use the
[expanded version command](/watchman/docs/cmd/version) to check compatibility
rather than interrogating the full list.

Here's some example output. The actual capabilities list is in unspecified order
and is much longer than is reproduced here:

    $ watchman list-capabilities{    "version": "3.8.0",    "capabilities": [        "field-mode",        "term-allof",        "cmd-trigger"    ]}

Note that watchman only reads the `.watchmanconfig` file when the watch is
established. If changes are made after that point, the `get-config` response
will not reflect them.

See [Configuration Options](/watchman/docs/config#configuration-options) for
details on valid contents of the `config` field. Note that the values returned
by `get-config` are passed straight through from the `.watchmanconfig` file, and
thus may contain fields that are not strictly legal.

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/cmd/flush-subscriptions

flush-subscriptions | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 4.8._

Flushes buffered updates to subscriptions associated with the current session,
guaranteeing that they are up-to-date as of the time Watchman received the
`flush-subscriptions` command.

Subscription updates will be interleaved between the `flush-subscriptions`
request and its response. Once the response has been received, subscriptions are
up-to-date.

This command is designed to be used by interactive programs that have a
background process or daemon maintaining a subscription to Watchman. The typical
pattern is for interactive commands to be forwarded to the process, which calls
`flush-subscriptions` and then processes any subscription updates it received.
This pattern eliminates races with files changed right before the interactive
command.

- `sync_timeout`: Required. The number of milliseconds to wait to observe a
  synchronization cookie. The synchronization cookie is created at the start of
  the `flush-subscriptions` call, and once the cookie is observed, means that
  the OS has sent watchman all the updates till at least the start of the
  `flush-subscriptions` call.
- `subscriptions`: Optional. Which subscriptions to flush. By default this
  flushes all subscriptions associated with this project on this session.

Assuming subscriptions `sub1`, `sub2` and `sub3` have been established on this
session, if `sub1` has updates pending, `sub2` is up-to-date and `sub3` is
currently dropping updates:

    ["flush-subscriptions", "/path/to/root", {"sync_timeout": 1000}]

In response, Watchman will first emit a unilateral subscription PDU for `sub1`,
then respond with

    {  "clock": "c:1446410081:18462:7:135",  "synced": ["sub1"],  "no_sync_needed": ["sub2"],  "dropped": ["sub3"]}

To flush updates for some but not all subscriptions associated with this
session:

    ["flush-subscriptions", "/path/to/root",  {    "sync_timeout": 1000,    "subscriptions": ["sub1", "sub2"]  }]

Subscriptions will typically buffer individual updates until a _settle_ period
has expired. `flush-subscriptions` will force those updates through immediately.

Subscriptions currently deferring updates because of `defer` or `defer_vcs` are
updated immediately, without waiting for the `defer` or `defer_vcs` to end.

Subscriptions currently dropping updates with a `drop` state will not get any
updates. Their names will be returned in the `dropped` field.

- `flush-subscriptions` can only be used to flush subscriptions associated with
  the current session.
- A single session can be subscribed to updates from multiple projects at the
  same time. However, `flush-subscriptions` can only flush updates for one
  project at a time.

clock | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 3.9._

_The [capability](/watchman/docs/capabilities) name associated with this
enhanced functionality is `clock-sync-timeout`._

`sync_timeout` specifies the number of milliseconds that you want to wait to
observe a synchronization cookie. The synchronization cookie is created at the
start of your clock call and, once the cookie is observed, means that the clock
value returned by this command is at least as current as the time of your clock
call.

If no `sync_timeout` is specified, the returned clock value is the instantaneous
value of the clock associated with the watched root, and may be almost
immediately invalidated if there are any filesystem notifications that are yet
to be processed.

    $ watchman clock /path/to/dir

JSON:

Note the third options argument is optional.

    ["clock", "/path/to/dir", {"sync_timeout": 100}]

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/clockspec

Clockspec | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

- number of seconds since the unix epoch (unix `time_t` style)
- a clock id of the form `c:123:234`
- a named cursor of the form `n:whatever` (but clock ids are faster!)

The first and most obvious is passing a unix timestamp. Watchman records the
observed time that files change and allows you to find files that have changed
since that time. Using a timestamp is prone to race conditions in understanding
the complete state of the file tree.

Using an abstract clock id insulates the client from these race conditions by
ticking as changes are detected rather than as time moves. Watchman returns the
current clock id when it delivers match results; you can use that value as the
clockspec in your next time relative query to get a race free assessment of
changed files.

As a convenience, watchman can maintain the last observed clock for a client by
associating it with a client defined cursor name. For example, you could
enumerate all the "C" source files on your first invocation of:

    watchman since /path/to/src n:c_srcs '*.c'

and when you run it a second time, it will show you only the "C" source files
that changed since the last time that someone queried using "n:c\_srcs" as the
clock spec. However, it's not possible to "roll back" a named cursor, so
advanced users desiring such functionality should use clock ids instead.

_Since 4.7._

We recommend not using the `n:whatever` form as it requires an exclusive lock on
the view to execute; this can increase contention and result in slower queries.

# Source: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/cli-options

Command Line | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The `watchman` executable contains both the client and the server components of
the watchman service.

By default, when `watchman` is run, it will attempt to communicate with your
existing server instance (each user has their own persistent process), and will
attempt to start it if it doesn't exist.

There are some options that affect how `watchman` will locate the server, some
options that affect only the client and some others that affect only the server.
Since all of the options are understood by the same executable we've broken
those out into sections of their own to make it clearer when they apply.

Watchman will prefer to resolve your user name from the `$USER` environmental
variable, or `$LOGNAME` if `$USER` was not set. If neither are set watchman will
look it up from the system using `getpwuid(getuid())`. When we refer to `<USER>`
in this documentation we mean the result of this resolution.

In some cases Watchman will need to create files in a temporary location.
Watchman will resolve this temporary location by looking at the `$TMPDIR`
environmental variable, or `$TMP` if `$TMPDIR` was not set. If neither are set
watchman will use `/tmp`. When we refer to `<TMPDIR>` in this documentation we
mean the result of this resolution.

Watchman tracks its persistent state in a location that we refer to as the
`<STATEDIR>` in this documentation.

_Since 3.1._

The `STATEDIR` defaulted to `<PREFIX>/var/run/watchman`. You can change this
default when you build watchman by using the configure option
`--enable-statedir`.

Earlier versions of Watchman didn't have a default statedir and would instead
use the `<TMPDIR>` for this state. We switched away from that because some
environments randomize the `<TMPDIR>` location and this made it difficult for
clients to locate the Watchman service.

_Since 3.8._

The `STATEDIR` defaults to `<PREFIX>/var/run/watchman/<USER>-state`. You can
change this default when you build watchman by using the configure option
`--enable-statedir`; the configure option replaces the
`<PREFIX>/var/run/watchman` portion of this string. If you specify
`--disable-statedir` then that portion of the string will be computed from the
`<TMPDIR>` location.

Watchman will create the `<USER>-state` portion if it does not exist, and will
perform some permission and ownership checks to reduce the risk of untrusted
users placing files in this location. If those checks are not satisfied,
watchman will refuse to start.

    -U, --sockname=PATH   Specify alternate sockname

The default location for sockname will be `<STATEDIR>/<USER>`. Older versions of
Watchman would default to `<TMPDIR>/.watchman.<USER>`, depending on how it was
configured.

If you are building a client to access the service programmatically, we
recommend that you invoke
[watchman get-sockname](/watchman/docs/cmd/get-sockname) to discover the path
that the client and server would use. This has the side effect of spawning the
service for you if it isn't already running.

The `watchman` executable will attempt to start the service if there is no
response on the socket specified above. In some cases it is desirable to avoid
starting the service if it isn't running:

    --no-spawn            Don't spawn service if it is not already running.                       Will try running the command in client mode if                       possible. --no-local            When no-spawn is enabled, don't use client mode

Client mode implements the [watchman find command](/watchman/docs/cmd/find) as
an immediate search.

These options control how the client talks to the server:

    -p, --persistent           Persist and wait for further responses     --server-encoding=ARG  CLI<->server encoding. json or bser.

Persistent connections have relatively limited use with the CLI, but can be
useful to connect ad-hoc to the service to receive logging information (See
[log-level](/watchman/docs/cmd/log-level)).

The server encoding option controls how requests and responses are formatted
when talking to the server. You generally shouldn't need to worry about this.

Most simple invocations of the CLI will pass a list of arguments:

    $ watchman watch /path/to/dir

This is turned into a request like this:

    ["watch", "/path/to/dir"]

and sent to the service using the
[Socket Interface](/watchman/docs/socket-interface).

The response is received and then sent to the `stdout` stream formatted based on
the selected output-encoding:

    --output-encoding=ARG  CLI output encoding. json (default) or bser     --no-pretty            Don't pretty print JSON output (more efficient                            when being processed by another program)

Each command has its own response output but watchman will always include a
field named `error` if something about the request was not successful. In case
of some protocol level errors (eg: connection was terminated) instead of
printing a response on `stdout`, an unstructured error message will be printed
to `stderr` and the process will exit with a non-zero exit status.

Instead of passing the request as command line parameters, you can send a JSON
representation on the `stdin` stream. These invocations are all equivalent:

    $ watchman watch /path/to/dir

    $ watchman -j <<-EOT["watch", "/path/to/dir"]EOT

    $ watchman -j <<< '["watch", "/path/to/dir"]'

    $ echo '["watch", "/path/to/dir"]' | watchman -j

    $ echo '["watch", "/path/to/dir"]' > cmd.json$ watchman -j < cmd.json

    $ watchman --json-command <<-EOT["watch", "/path/to/dir"]EOT

_Since 3.8_

The CLI now also recognizes BSER as a valid input stream when using the `-j`
option. This will implicitly set `--server-encoding=bser` and
`--output-encoding=bser` if those options have not been set to something else.

The `watchman` binary will exit with a return code of 0 in most cases; this
indicates that the output it generated should be valid JSON. To determine if
your command was successful, you need to parse the JSON and look for the `error`
field as described above.

`watchman` will exit with a non-zero exit status in cases where something
low-level went wrong, such as protocol level errors (eg: connection was
terminated).

These options are used when starting the server. They are recognized by the
client and affect how it will start the server, but have no effect if the server
is already running. To change the effective values of these options for a
running server, you will need to restart it (you can stop it by running
[watchman shutdown-server](/watchman/docs/cmd/shutdown-server)).

By default, watchman will remember all watches and associated triggers and
reinstate them if the process is restarted. This state is stored in the
_statefile_:

    --statefile=PATH      Specify path to file to hold watch and trigger state -n, --no-save-state   Don't save state between invocations

The default location for statefile will be `<STATEDIR>/<USER>.state`. Older
versions of watchman may store the state in `<TMPDIR>/.watchman.<USER>.state`,
depending on how they were configured.

    -o, --logfile=PATH   Specify path to logfile    --log-level      set log verbosity (0 = off, default is 1, verbose = 2)

The default location for logfile will be `<STATEDIR>/<USER>.log`. Older versions
of watchman may store the logs in `<TMPDIR>/.watchman.<USER>.log`, depending on
how they were configured.

In some relatively uncommon circumstances, such as in test harnesses, you may
need to directly run the service without it putting itself into the background:

    -f, --foreground      Run the service in the foreground

_Since 4.6._

    --inetd                Spawning from an inetd style supervisor

When this flag is specified, watchman will use stdin as the listening socket
rather than attempting to set it up for itself. This allows some other process
to maintain the socket and defer activating the watchman service until a client
is ready to connect. This is most practically beneficial when used together with
`systemd`.

Case-Insensitivity | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

Watchman is currently completely unaware of case-insensitivity in file systems,
and does not attempt to do any case-folding of file names. On a case-insensitive
file system like macOS's [HFS+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus), this
can manifest itself in different ways:

- If a file `foo.txt` is renamed to `FOO.txt`, Watchman will report `FOO.txt` as
  created and `foo.txt` separately as changed.
- If a file `foo.txt` is removed and another file `FOO.txt` is later added,
  Watchman will report `FOO.txt` as added, but it might report `foo.txt` as
  either removed or changed.

In general, both `foo.txt` and `FOO.txt` can be reported, sometimes with
different stat data, sometimes with the same stat data.

One problem is that 'properly' is hard to pin down. There are at least four
levels of correctness here:

- handle ASCII case-folding only (95% solution)
- handle ASCII + accented ASCII case-folding only (98%)
- full handling of current Unicode spec using a Unicode database (99%)
- using the special folding table written to a hidden file on disk at file
  system creation time that matches Apple's interpretation of Unicode at the
  time of the OS release + their own quirks (100%)

Clients of Watchman might have their own idea of case-folding, which might or
might not be compatible with Watchman's idea of it. So far, clients have managed
to handle case-folding outside of Watchman, with some success.

It depends on your application.

**Example 1:** Your application is a build system that has a pre-baked list of
files. Your application expects files to be on disk in the correct case even on
case-insensitive file systems, and you declare that the behavior is undefined if
they aren't. You invoke Watchman by asking it what files have changed. In this
case, Watchman should work without you having to do anything special.

**Example 2:** Your application is a build system rule to generate CSS rules
that is run by a Watchman trigger on `*.scss`. You expect all files you care
about to end with the string `.scss` on case-insensitive file systems, and not
another variant of it like `.SCSS`. In this case, Watchman should work fine --
at most, it will provide you the same file multiple times with different case
variants. You might be dealing with that in your build system anyway.

**Example 3:** Like example 2, except you expect `.SCSS` and other variants to
work too. In that case the only way is to explicitly add all possible variants
to the trigger rule.

**Example 4:** You're a source control system that has its own ideas about
case-folding that might or might not match up with the operating system's. You
perform case-folding against an internal data structure, so that if the data
structure has `foo.txt` and the file system has `FOO.txt` you make `foo.txt`
take precedence. In that case, Watchman will tell you about both `FOO.txt` and
`foo.txt`, and it's up to you to perform normalization.
[hgwatchman](https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hgwatchman) just consults the file
system in the rare case that a file changes case.

The levels of correctness were proposed by Matt Mackall
[mpm@selenic.com](mailto:mpm@selenic.com).

Capabilities | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

_Since 3.8_

Capability names are used to identify modules that are either conditionally
configured or that are introduced over time.

You can use the [expanded version command](/watchman/docs/cmd/version) to query
capabilities and avoid building knowledge of version numbers in your client
application(s).

You can use [list-capabilities](/watchman/docs/cmd/list-capabilities) command to
obtain a list of capabilities supported by your watchman server.

Every command is identified by the command name prefixed by the string `cmd-`.
For example, the `watch-project` command is indicated by the capability name
`cmd-watch-project`.

Every expression term is identified by the term name prefixed by the string
`term-`. For example, the `match` term is indicated by the capability name
`term-match`.

Every field is identified by the field name prefixed by the string `field-`. For
example, the `size` field is indicated by the capability name `field-size`.

Sometimes we will enhance existing functionality by adding new options to
existing commands. Since these changes won't result in adding a new command they
won't implicitly gain a capability name. In these cases we'll assign an
appropriate capability name by hand.

The following feature capabilities are possible / released:

BSER Binary Protocol | Watchman

[Skip to main content](#)

The basic JSON protocol in watchman allows quick and easy integration.
Applications with higher performance requirements may want to consider the
binary protocol instead.

The binary protocol is enabled by the client sending the byte sequence
"\\x00x\\x01".

A PDU is prefixed by its length expressed as an encoded integer. This allows the
peer to determine how much storage is required to read and decode it.

Arrays are indicated by a `0x00` byte value followed by an integer value to
indicate how many items follow. Then each item is encoded one after the other.

Objects are indicated by a `0x01` byte value followed by an integer value to
indicate the number of properties in the object. Then each key/value pair is
encoded one after the other.

Strings are indicated by a `0x02` byte value followed by an integer value to
indicate the number of bytes in the string, followed by the bytes of the string.

Unlike JSON, strings are not defined as having any particular encoding; they are
transmitted as binary strings. This is because the underlying filesystem APIs
don't define any particular encoding for names.

_Exception:_ Keys in objects that are defined by watchman commands are always
ASCII. In general, keys in objects are always UTF-8.

_Rationale:_ Several programming languages like Python 3 expect all text to be
in a particular encoding and make it inconvenient to pass in bytestrings or
other encodings. Also, the primary purpose of not defining an encoding is that
filenames don't always have one, and filenames are unlikely to show up as keys.

All integers are signed and transmitted in the host byte order of the system
running the watchman daemon.

- `0x03` indicates an int8\_t. It is followed by the int8\_t value.
- `0x04` indicates an int16\_t. It is followed by the int16\_t value.
- `0x05` indicates an int32\_t. It is followed by the int32\_t value.
- `0x06` indicates an int64\_t. It is followed by the int64\_t value.

A real number is indicated by a `0x07` byte followed by 8 bytes of double value.

- `0x08` indicates boolean true
- `0x09` indicates boolean false

`0x0a` indicates the null value

`0x0b` indicates a compact array of objects follows. Some of the bigger
datastructures returned by watchman are tabular data expressed as an array of
objects. This serialization type factors out the repeated object keys into a
header array listing the keys, followed by an array containing all the values of
the objects.

To represent missing keys in templated arrays, the `0x0c` encoding value may be
present. If encountered it is interpreted as meaning that there is no value for
the key that would have been decoded in this position. This is distinct from the
null value.

For example:

    [   {"name": "fred", "age": 20},   {"name": "pete", "age": 30},   {"age": 25 },]

is represented similar to:

    ["name", "age"],[  "fred", 20,  "pete", 30,  0x0c,   25]

The precise sequence is:

    0b          template00          array     -- start prop names0302        int, 2    -- two prop names02          string    -- first prop "name"0304        int, 46e616d65    "name"02          string    -- 2nd prop "age"0303        int, 3616765      "age"0303        int, 3    -- there are 3 objects02          string    -- object 1, prop 1 name=fred0304        int, 466726564    "fred"0314        int 0x14  -- object 1, prop 2 age=2002          string    -- object 2, prop 1 name=pete0304        int 470657465    "pete"031e        int, 0x1e -- object 2, prop 2 age=300c          skip      -- object 3, prop 1, not set0319        int, 0x19 -- object 3, prop 2 age=25

Note: to avoid hostile "decompression bombs", Watchman will reject parsing
template objects that have an empty set of keys.
